35104	135143267	42797	97166582	Daelan	The apartment was clean and just as described. Reading instructions will get you through everything and great communication. Thanks again! 
35104	136392342	42804	65425263	Casey	Jay's place was great. It was very clean, especially because of the cleaning service. We met the cleaning ladies when we dropped our bags, and they were also very friendly. The location is definitely the BEST part of this place. Safe, and very close to the Subway! 
35104	138356276	42813	86947196	Leo	Clean, as described. Communicative and friendly.
35104	139250690	42818	2893570	Solomon	First the apartment is very small and crowded. The place is clean and the neighborhood is ok. But the host is very irresponsible. We contacted him the first few days after we booked the place because we found out that we have three person instead of two which is almost a month before we arrive in ny. He said he will figure it out. After contacting him several times after he said he won't allow three person so I asked to cancel the first night since it's the only night we have three person. He charged us for 50% refund or add $67 for extra person. We feel that he is irresponsible and should have let us know earlier to plan it. Plus the room is unbelievable hot, the ventilation wasn't good. 
27983	85826725	42564	45022045	Nakaj	This apartment is a perfect place to visit ny. Close to the subway and in the  wonderful nolita. The place is small but clean and she is flexible with your arrival and departure time.
27983	93727874	42595	41284227	Ana	I had i great stay on Sarah's apartament. Incredible location in the hart of Nolita/soho, close walking to many good restaurants, bars and nightlife, close to best place to shopping, close to little italy and china town. Many subways stations around  that takes you to anywhere in Manhattan.The room and all the apartament was very clean and confortable. It was summer and the room was equiped with air conditioning. Sarah was very nice host, she sent me a pdf before I arrived with many good tips of places arround. I apreciated it. And she was always avaiable to respond any questions and always very friendly. The apartamente has a kitchen where you can cook if you want. I apreciated my stay and certainly will come back.

26142	130386008	42771	59232157	Andrea	Great host.
26142	131498342	42778	89184485	Kylie	Dorian is great. He pops in and out at good times and it was nice to actually meet him! Everything was clean, easy to understand and the location was great. As a couple from out of town this was an awesome experience. He is a sweet heart!
32828	91205137	42586	82114599	Marc	MalgrÃ© notre arrivÃ©e tardive vers 23h, nous (2 adultes et 2 enfants) Ã©tions attendus et accueillis. La chambre semble petites mais possÃ¨de beaucoup de meubles de rangement trÃ¨s pratiques pouvant contenir nos 4 valises, ainsi que des Ã©quipements pour y vivre car nous avions cuisinÃ© et pris au moins notre petit dÃ©jeuner et dÃ®ner dedans, mÃªme sâ??il y a plein de restaurants proches sur la 2nd Avenue. Le mÃ©tro nâ??est pas Ã  cÃ´tÃ©, mais grÃ¢ce au Wifi de la maison et Uber, la 5th Avenue et Central Park sont Ã  5mn en voiture de lÃ  pour moins de $10 la course. Puis, câ??est calme car nous dormions bien la nuit.
32828	94371520	42597	9984743	Massimo	Daniela is a great host! She is able to resolve any kind of problems and she is able to feel you at home. Thanks again Daniela.
32828	96003047	42603	88714165	Luke	Despite the fact that we gave only a few hours notice, Daniela provided us with a great place to stay, in a great location, and worked to make sure we had a wonderful experience in NYC.
32828	96093472	42603	91182289	Isaiah	The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
32828	98083384	42611	90987339	Maria	This is a lovely apartment that does really make you feel at home. The bed is very comfortable. The neighborhood is fun and safe, short walk to Central Park. Daniela gave so many great restaurant recommendations for me as well!
32828	99353575	42617	87570239	Eden	I felt welcome and it was very nice. 
32828	101829934	42628	84915246	Daniella	Daniela is a wonderful host, always replied our questions quickly and gave us tips about the area.  The apartment is exactly as shown at the pictures, in a very busy area with a lot of places to eat nearby but very quiet at night for sleeping, perfect. Near to the Central Park and subway helped a lot in our plans. We traveled in a group of 4 and we stayed confortably. I would reccomend the apartment to anyone.
32828	104631681	42640	76545769	Pilar	El emplazamiento del apartamento es magnifico, sin duda lo mejor  que ofrece. Es pequeÃ±o, pero suficiente para tres adultos. Responde perfectamente a las expectativas del anuncio. La anfitriona atendiÃ³ inmediatamente y resolviÃ³ todas las peticiones de mejora que le hicimos y, aunque no la hemos conocido personalmente, ha estado accesible en todo momento. Lo recomiendo sin lugar a dudas.
32828	105952027	42646	12272981	Laura	Apartment was exactly as listed. Good location and only a few blocks from the subway. Daniela's father-in-law was waiting for us at the apartment when we arrived and oriented us to the apartment; he was very kind. Daniela was quick to respond with all messages and was very flexible with us and let us keep our luggage in the apartment past our check-out time, so we didn't have to carry it around the city with us in the last few hours of our stay in NYC before we left for the airport. Great place to stay in NYC! Love the area as well. 
32828	107590039	42654	92264949	Yves	Nous avons Ã©tÃ© agrÃ©ablement accueillis par le beau pere de Daniela, Ã  une heure tardive, il nous a expliquÃ© ce qu'il fallait savoir, et nous a laissÃ© son numÃ©ro de tÃ©lÃ©phone en cas de besoin. Daniela, qui Ã©tait au BrÃ©sil, a communiquÃ© rÃ©guliÃ¨rement avec nous par e-mail pour savoir si tout Ã©tait ok. 
32828	108610212	42659	72009215	Giovanna	Daniela is so sweet, very responsive and gave us flexibility with our entrance hour. We're very satisfied. 
7417	1035576	40991	320569	Sean	Ana's place was great. She was super cool always getting back to me all the way from Egypt. And Her roommates are amazing also. And its so close to the train that is all worked out so perfect. And the best part roof access!!!
7417	1138561	41015	815005	Edward	Great location and very nice room. The (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) were all very nice and the space is located very close to the subway, restaurants, and laundry facilities. Anamaria was very helpful!
7417	6922453	41516	7332010	Alison	I stayed here for a week, and it was a lovely apt - I also enjoyed hanging out with the other girls living here. Just as pictured and a very good deal. 
7417	7128725	41524	6296225	Michelle	Ana's roommate Sasha met me and gave me the key at her workplace.  The apartment was not far away.  Sasha was very kind and even let me use one of her towels during my stay.  The apartment was conveniently located a few minutes walk from the L and M trains.
7417	7231059	41528	7781482	Sebastian	truly a great place. the room is huge and beautifully decorated, has a window, fan, ac and everything else you might need. a clean apartment overall. i wasn't there a lot, but when i was it was very quiet so i got enough sleep.i didn't get to meet anamaria but her friend showed me around and gave me the keys when i arrived.if you're looking for a place where bushwick still has it's charm, you found it. and for anything else there's the L train which is just a short walk away.
8039	108287823	42658	47729898	Ksenya	We stayed at Sandip's place 5 days while he was away, visiting NY. Despite being away, Sandip has organized well our arrival, left us all instructions and provided a backup contact of his neighbor. He also replied rapidly to our inquiries.We've had a positive overall experience, we liked his place, the location was convenient for commuting to Manhattan, and Carroll Gardens neighborhood is very nice.The apartment is nice and spacious, corresponding perfectly to the photos and the description. The building is old, close to a highway, hence some noise (we haven't had issues at night though as bedroom is located on the other side of the building).  Some minor issues with cleanliness of some spots in the kitchen and in the shower.
8039	120729866	42715	30419145	Konstantin	Great apartment! I was beyond satisfied with it. Sandip wasn't there for my arrival, but he made sure the apartment was in a great condition when I got there. Neighborhood is very quiet, but there are many restaurants, stores, and bars within a 2 block walk. 
25986	11905083	41747	6130592	Daniel	Great stay, comfortable apartment in a great area. Michelle was extremely accommodating as well! Fantastic!
25986	12092845	41751	13095001	Pedro	Me and my friends spent a weekend with Michelle and it was amazing! The room is fantastic and it is also very close to many New york's attractions! I strongly recommend it!!
25986	12564366	41764	3679737	Mario	Great Location, great food, bars and restaurants nearby. Michelle welcomes you and helps you out where she can! Comfy and clean room! Very glad I stayed there!!!!
25986	12893863	41772	11287332	Lucie	Living in MichelleÂ´s place was really nice. All rooms were nicely cleaned, everything was prepared and arranged. We would like to say a big THANK YOU for great time we had there !!
25986	13355081	41785	14055019	Ana	We stayed for 7 days at NYC and it was like we were at home. Michelle is really really friendly and a very good host, like her boyfriend, they both welcomed us without problems. We were most of the day outside walking around the city, so we have not seen a lot Michelle; the house was very nice and overall very clean. The room is a little small for two people, but for us it was enough because we dindnÂ´t stay at home a lot during our trip. We donâ??t know if it was fatigue, but ... the bed was really comfortable! The neighborhood is away from the bustle of Manhattan, (which is much appreciated when you come home after a long day exploring the crazy city). Have a subway stop a few meters from the street and in the front bar (called Eastwood) you can have a beer or even dine in a pleasant atmosphere. We highly recommend staying at Michelle's house, would return there on our next trip FOR SURE!! Thank you so much Michelle ;)
25986	13573370	41790	6384986	Robert	We had a great stay at home of Michelle Brotherton. Ð© The home: Clean! Compact, as are all NYC residences. Soon one appreciates the cozy architectural design. Our hostess had placed all furniture with care to allow easy transit within the residence. Hostess gave us kitchen privileges, including coffeemaker. Any kitchen item that could be shared was labeled as such. Our space was sufficiently private.Ð© The Spectacular Neighborhood:  Quiet! We walked to local restaurants and through China Town to Ground Zero and to subway.Ð© The City This is the Lower East Side, a lovely part of NYC.
25986	13847858	41796	12872370	Sarah	We stayed with Michelle for 4 nights and 5 days and it was great! The apartment was really cute- the room (and apartment) was neat and organized and it was quiet at night. Michelle was fantastic. She was always interested in our day and the plans we had, and she had great suggestions for the questions we asked her! They were so friendly and accommodating. If you're considering staying here, you should definitely do it!
25986	14734863	41815	13162722	Aurore	The stay at Michelleâ??s apartment was really nice. The room was clean and Michelle prepared everything for our arrival. The apartment is ideally located, with a lot of bars and restaurants around. We appreciated the fact that Michelle is very respectful of the guestsâ?? privacy. We recommend it! Merci Michelle :-)
25986	15173708	41824	13942315	Jb	Michelle is a great host, and made all the arrangements for us to feel almost home when getting in the apartment. The apartment is very well located, just a few block from the subway and easy to walk to China Town/Little Italy, Brooklyn Bridge etc...Would definitely stay there again!
25986	18190026	41874	19009343	Naomie	Clean apartment, key location close to China town, cool bars & restaurants. Also conveniently close to the Williamsburg, Brooklyn and Manhattan bridges. Michelle and Richard were super helpful and tidy. We felt very comfortable in the apartment and loved our experience. 
25986	18423391	41877	1884338	Alexandra	I had a great stay at this cosy apartment and felt right at home. The room is compact, but has everything you need and fitted me comfortably. The air con was welcome for warm summer nights, reliable wifi and great shower. Loved the neighbourhood - a perfect base for exploring Lower Manhattan and Williamsburg on foot. The photos don't do it justice. Wish I could have stayed longer.  Thanks Michelle & Richard!
25986	18565653	41879	18866596	Massimo	Michelle was very helpful and the room was exactly like describe. The apartement was clean and very good situated. I injoyed the time, thank you Michelle:)
25986	18893637	41884	5921682	Patricia	Michelle est gentille et son appartement est trÃ¨s propre. Il est situÃ© Ã  seulement quelques coins de rues du mÃ©tro. On peut aussi aller prendre un verre ou manger quelque chose au Clinton Pub (trÃ¨s sympa, excellent Fish & Ship) juste en face de l'appart.
25986	19272220	41891	18891467	Fleury	My stay was very short (2 nights), but I could appreciate the quality of the welcome. Michelle put me immediately at ease by showing me everything I may need in the apartment to make me feel like I was home. Obviously there is a minimum of rules to follow and that is clearly displayed in the room, but you are totally free to come and go at any time, it does not bother them at all. The room matches exactly to the original description, no surprises.
25986	19416006	41894	19179665	AgnÃ¨s	Michelle est trÃ¨s douce et son copain trÃ¨s sympa. Ils sont trÃ¨s discrets et respectent l'intimitÃ© des voyageurs de passage. L'appartement est tout prÃªt de la ligne F du mÃ©tro et Ã  seulement 20min de Times Square. IdÃ©al pour rentrer de reposer avant de ressortir le soir. Adresse Ã  conserver pour un prochain voyage Ã  New York je les recommande vivement. 
25986	20488717	41912	6557769	Johannes	Thank you Michelle! We (2 Persons) really enjoyed our stay in this small, but cozy room. In the appartment, there was everything to feel comfortable. For any questions we had, Michelle helped us out. Its an exiting neighbourhood, and a good location for exploring the City. Good Spirit.
25986	20911565	41919	14399826	Emma	I recent stayed three nights with Michelle and Richard. It was a very comfortable stay. The unit and room were very clean and comfortable. The location was great to explore the lower east side and Brooklyn. There is also a subway stop close by. Michelle and Richard made my stay very easy. They were considerate and friendly. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks Michelle!
25986	21070962	41923	15487405	Claudia	Meine Tochter und ich haben uns in Michelles Wohnung wohl und gut aufgehoben gefÃ¼hlt. Sie und Richard sind sehr freundlich, hilfsbereit und diskret. Das Zimmer war sauber und hell und das Bett sehr bequem. Die Wohnung ist gut gelegen, um mit der Metro bequem Manhattan zu entdecken. Wir kommen gerne wieder. Danke Michelle! 
25986	21574821	41932	11685346	Anneke	Michelle's apartment is a great place to stay. Michelle and Richard were very friendly and helpful but we could still totally do our own thing. The room was smaller than expected but it has everything you need, it's very clean and the bed is really comfortable. The location is great too, close to the subway, Brooklyn and some great restaurants (Dudley's, Eastwood, thanks for the advice)! Michelle helped us out greatly when we needed advice about the public transport to and from the airport. Last but not least, the breakfast was simple but we really appreciated it. Will definitely stay there again when in New York.
25986	22288234	41946	6814385	Mette	we spent a week at michelles and it all worked out very well. the room is a bit small but who cares - we only came there to sleep. the apartment is kept nice and clean. and the bagels were good! thanks michelle!
25986	22489741	41951	21331414	Bob	I recieved a warm welcome from Michelle and Richard, the apartment was very clean and tidy. The neighbourhood felt safe and only a short walk to East Broadway metro, which I found a great way to travel around, but a good walk will also get you to the main attractions. My room was very comfortable and met all my needs, I would not hesitate to try and book again if the opportunity to return happens
25986	22796182	41958	22181322	Andrew	All comms and arrangements were prompt, accurate and good.
25986	22947116	41961	21587907	Trevor	Meg and I had a good start to our NY weekend with a conversation with Michelle about nearby places while she printed maps for us. Our room was very clean and comfortable, and the apartment was homely. Richard was pleasant the few times we saw him. This apartment is located very close to the subway line which made it incredibly easy to explore.
25986	23014051	41963	19990632	Matt	This was my first ever AirBnB stay and it was great. Michelle and Richard were extremely accommodating and easygoing and made my stay stress free. The subway is nearby and getting around is easy. Brooklyn is minutes away by train (I know because I got on going the wrong way). The room was plenty for me (I'm 6-5) and even though I was longer than the bed, I slept like a baby. I will definitely consider staying there in the future. Thanks again!
25986	23239590	41969	21464799	Enrique	Esta ha sido la primera vez que uso el AirBnB y me fue excelente. El cuarto es examentamente como la foto es muy acogedora ,privada limpia  y comoda. Michaelle aunque no la vimos mucho por que estuve siempre fuera fue una excelente anfitriona. El metro estÃ¡ cerca solo use taxi para ir del Aeropuerto a su casa. Todo perfecto Gracias.Espero regresar pronto
25986	23746078	41982	22243448	Hans	We stayed for a week in the apartment and had a very good time. The room was small but clean. The apartment is very well situated in Manhattan. You can walk from there to a lot of interesting stops and the subway is just 2 blocks from the house.Michelle and her friend Richard are friendly and helpful.
25986	23839020	41985	18143813	Shauna	We had a great time in NYC... didn't spend a lot of time in the room because there is plenty to do! Not a ton of space, but didn't expect it to be big! The apartment is clean, warm and safe. There is a really cool bar just across the road that we enjoyed spending time in and the location is great for access to subway. Lots to do nearby as well. Michelle was a great host - she even left us umbrellas to use when the weather wasn't too great!
25986	24072360	41992	21128042	Helena	Quite nice located- next to Chinatown and Little Italy. When you walk longer you can reach easily Noho, Soho and East Village. Very clean, but just a small room- fits better for one person- u dont have a wardrobe. Open kitchen with living room flair. Michelle and Richard were always welcoming, open for questions, giving you tips. Free books, bagels, coffee, umbrella, German Tour Guide Book, towels. Thanks for having me and my friend! We loved the NYC experience! Thank you so much.
25986	24177643	41995	22341260	Cristiane	The location is excellent,  close to subway stations, bars and restaurants. Quite small room for a couple as I stayed with my husband but was enough for few days. Very clean, warm and cosy. We didn't have too much opportunity of contact with Michelle a part from our last day but she was very nice and friendly. We would definitely get back. 
25986	24308535	41998	24488384	Thomas	Michelle's apartment is perfect for couples. It is truly well situated in Manhattan. Few minutes in metro are required to get main sites. She offered bagels, tea and coffee for breakfast. We felt welcomed. The room was clean and warm and she also provided towels. She and her family are really kind. Merci beaucoup !
25986	25042864	42009	24594374	Zach	The place across the street where we picked up our keys, Eastwood, was pretty cool for drinks/eats.  The host was very nice and the bagels for breakfast she provided, along with the vast selection of teas, we were extremely thankful for.  The bed is absurdly comfortable, the sheets and pillows were made of magical softness.  The only catch is there is a pipe in the room (or above it) that had a dripping noise and the bed creaks a lot when you move.  It was fine nonetheless, and we aren't particularly heavy sleepers.  The location is fairly near to a few subway stations (although you could figure this out on (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) Maps).  All in all, thanks for the cool lodging, the price was unbeatable.(unrelated side note: I accidentally left my American Crew shampoo and conditioner there, I hope someone gets good use out of it!)
25986	27363393	42065	27971756	Anish	Neighborhood: PerfectHost: Very cordial and accommodatingAmenities: WiFi, Living Room and TV for use, Tea and Coffee and Bagels in the kitchenSpace: Very clean and orderly. Accommodates two people comfortably. Temperature was maintained to a very comfortable level.Overall: A very pleasant experience
25986	28652168	42091	27274663	Sarah	My husband and I stayed for two weeks at Michelle's and had an amazing time in New York. The apartment was just perfect. It was quiet, clean and very cosy.The apartment is located in a good neighborhood, close to a great bar, restaurants, fast food places and is very close to the subway station.Michelle and Richard were really nice and helpful all the time. Both gave us a lot of sightseeing and restaurant tips. Richard and Michelle have the best taste in music, movies and tv shows. We were kindly provided with towels, umbrellas and free bagels, coffee and jam for breakfast. We could even use the kitchen when ever we liked. We were even allowed to use spices from Michelle's amazing stock.Thank you very much for the hospitality. You made us feel very welcome and we had a great time. We would definitely recommend the apartment to our friends! Thank you very much!
25986	29003489	42096	197711	J. B.	Gracious host, beautiful apartment, great location. One of the best AirBnB rentals in Manhattan. 
25986	29664706	42105	27264781	Michaela	We had an awesome stay at Michelle's appartement. The location is great - with metro F you can reach nearly every sight in New York, the appartement clean, tidy and quiet, the hosts very helpful and nice.
25986	30085069	42111	29365415	Johanna	I would highly recommend staying at Michelle's house! Both M and her man are two lovely humans, they helped us out with recommendations and bagels with jam every morning.I have only good things to say about our stay there, and I willBring good memories back home to sthlm. Thanks again M! 
25986	31636885	42132	11588860	Kevin	This location is great! It is close to subway stops so that you can go where ever you need. The room is nice and looks exactly like the pictures. The host is very accommodating with checking in and checking out. Thank you for letting us stay here! 
25986	32316413	42141	12721783	Mathieu	Great location in manhattan and closed to subway stops ( east broadway station)...Michelle and her family are so sweet and pleasant...you can ask all questions about NY city.The accommodation is cosy but you have got everything you need. Regarding the breakfast it depends if michelle had enough time to buy bagels ;)We recommend this offer.See youSuper location dans manhattan, la famille de Michelle est agrÃ©able et avenante...vous pouvez poser toutes vos questions aux hÃ´tes sur NYC..on ne se marche pas dessus et chacun respecte l espace de vie.Nous recommandons cette location bon rapport qualitÃ©-prix et emplacement.
25986	33568733	42154	25492423	Romain	Michelle et Richard sont trÃ¨s sympas, nous avons Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s bien accueillis! L'appartement Ã©tait trÃ¨s propre, trÃ¨s chaleureux et les deux petits chats trop mignons! La chambre est cosy, les serviettes et draps sont fournis, ainsi que les parapluies et des guides de NYC.  Le lit Ã©tait vraiment trÃ¨s confortable, ce qui est vraiment agrÃ©able aprÃ¨s avoir crapahutÃ© toute la journÃ©e dans la ville. La salle de bain Ã©tait trÃ¨s propre, refaite Ã  neuf, avec douche/baignoire. Le petit dÃ©jeuner Ã©tait super : thÃ©, cafÃ©, bagels, beurre et confiture. Nous avons pu utiliser la cuisine certains soirs quand nous n'avions pas envie de sortir. Michelle dispose d'un choix d'Ã©pices impressionnant. Nous avons Ã©galement passÃ© une soirÃ©e super sympa en regardant Game Of Thrones en direct ! L'appartement Ã©tait super bien situÃ©, Ã  deux pas de Chinatown entre le Lower East Side et l'East Village avec tous les services Ã  proximitÃ© (deli, pizzeria, pharmacie, tabac, supÃ©rette, subway...). La ligne de mÃ©tro F est Ã  5 minutes Ã  pied (station East Broadway). L'immeuble est calme, l'appartement est au 2Ã¨me Ã©tage sans ascenseur et le quartier trÃ¨s tranquille. Nous sommes restÃ©s 13 nuits chez Michelle et Richard et recommandons vivement cette location!  Merci encore Ã  vous deux pour votre accueil chaleureux
25986	34657537	42165	32712901	Jane	The house is very clean and cosy. Michelle and her BF are very friendly . We enjoyed our stay there. 
25986	35454369	42174	15904033	Tor-BjÃ¶rn	We can only give the best of review to Michelle and her family, they were wonderful hosts. The location is very, very good, close to central metro/subway lines going to the center. But at this location you can easily walk to the sights in lower Manhattan.
25986	36518277	42184	865979	Roberto And Andrea	Michelle and her family were very friendly and welcoming. The listing was accurate and she also accommodated by allowing us to drop our bags before the agreed check in time. The neighborhood is great with nice coffee shops and close to transport. the bed was very good. The room is a bit small, and the bathroom is shared among everybody in the apartment but everything was spotlessly clean.
25986	37143414	42190	19530681	Monique	We had a wonderful time at Mâ??s place. Nice location. Only a few minuteâ??s walk to the subway station and the room was exactly as shown on the photos. The key pickup went smooth and a kind bystander helped us to bring our suitcases upstairs. We were very happy with the airco in our room because is was hot in Ney York City. The coffee and bagels in the morning are a nice touch! Michelle and her friend are very kind. It was our first experience with Airbnb, but certainly not the last! It was a pleasure to stay at Michelleâ??s place and we can recommend it to anyone who want to see New York. 
25986	38253524	42199	28765329	Laurent	Nous avons passÃ© un trÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour!L appartement Ã©tait trÃ¨s bien situÃ©, propre, accueillant et le lit confortable !Michelle est sympathique et trÃ¨s discrÃ¨te, nous ne l avons pas beaucoup vue durant notre sÃ©jour !
25986	38917043	42204	37520661	Francesca	We enjoyed 15 through 18 July 2015 in Lower Side Manhattan in Michelle's place. Everything  is like what is descripted in the Airbnb post but the cat's name! ;-) Nice, clean, tidy, small but comfortable, the stairs might be better but all that is in Michelle's control is just fine and welcoming. Nice hosts as well and convenient place few minutes from Metro F which brings you everywhere! I'd for sure go back to this place. Thanks!!!
25986	39634650	42210	15509566	Peter	Very nice and tidy appartment.  The bed is comfy and the room is surprisingly quite - aircon has v much appreciated.  Michelle and Richard were very polite and helpful when we had any queries, but other than that we barely saw them.Our only slight issue was that the bedroom is very small!  Would be ok if you didnt have much luggage but we had a lot so really struggled for floor space.  This aside, we would definatley recommend staying with Michelle and her family.
25986	40331577	42215	20848509	Dario	Siamo arrivati di notte ma non ci sono stati problemi a trovare l'appartamento che si trova veramente in una ottima posizione, a due passi da due stazioni della metro ed in un quartiere pieno di negozi e locali. Si trova accanto al palazzo rosso che si vede in Mr Robot, per chi lo conosce. Appartamento completissimo ed arredato con gusto, inquilini gentili e disponibili a dare consigli per visitare la cittÃ . Molto pulito. Asciugamani puliti a disposizione. PossibilitÃ  di avere caffÃ¨ alla mattina, di fare la spesa, tenerla nel frigo e cucinare, basta ovviamente lasciare in ordine! Che dire, se potessi, ci tornerei subito!
25986	41580381	42224	29808349	Francisca	We had a very nice stay at this apartment. Michelle is nice and helpful. One remark: the room is REALLY small. We had two (normal) suitcases and we struggled with space. The rest of the apartment is also tiny, but comfortable and clean. The location is great, the subway is only two blocks away. 
25986	44517562	42243	29784839	Sabrina	La posizione Ã¨ perfetta! La stanza purtroppo Ã¨ davvero piccola: Ã¨ stato impossibile aprire le valige. Adatto a soggiorni brevi con solo bagaglio a mano. Michelle e il suo compagno sono gentili e disponibili.
25986	46267326	42256	32991409	Bruce	My first time in New York was incredible. Couldn't have asked for better weather and the people were amazing. Luckily for me I was able to find this very nice place with Michelle. The room is lovely with everything so well organized. Intact the whole apartment was well organized. She was very hospitable and welcoming. For the most part I was out but never felt like I was invading or unwelcome. The location is great! LES with a great pizza place down stairs, which I highly recommend. Ask for Steve he is one cool dude. Highly recommend this place. If I ever need to and I get the chance to I would try and stay there again. Enough room for two people if you're going with someone and very convenient to almost everything. Cheers!
25986	47345134	42265	31933547	Nils	Sehr gute Lage, gute Austattung und sehr nette Gastgeber.FÃ¼r Manhattan groÃ?zÃ¼gig und ein guter Preis.Michelle und Richard sind sehr unkompliziert.Sehr zu empfehlen.Ob zu FuÃ?, oder mit der Subway ist man schnell dort, wo wir hin wollten.
25986	47972942	42269	12990822	Romain	Nous avons passÃ© un excellent sÃ©jour chez Michelle. HÃ´tes trÃ¨s discrets que nous avons croisÃ©s que trÃ¨s rarement. L'appartement est trÃ¨s bien situÃ© sur Manhattan, Ã  2 pas de la station East Broadway sur la ligne F. L'appartement est trÃ¨s cosy. Un peu bruyant du fait de la grand route passant Ã  cotÃ© de la chambre. Le prix Ã  payer pour Ãªtre dans Manhattan. TrÃ¨s propre. Merci Michelle et Richard
25986	50916453	42293	5691607	Bruni	A great place, centrally located, subway station in short walking distance and therefore perfect for exploring the city. The appartement is really nice, clean, a welcoming atmosphere. We can totally recommend it.
25986	51435200	42297	40317017	Jamey	We had a very comfortable stay with Michelle.  Her place was just as she stated - it was very clean and organized.  We enjoyed having coffee & tea and bagels with jam for breakfast and the bed was so comfortable after our long days of sight seeing in NYC.  Thank you Michelle.  We highly recommend others staying with you.
25986	52674818	42309	4777986	Mikel	"The apartment is located in the Lower East Side, 5 min walk to Chinatown and Little Italy. Besides, there is only 3 min walk to the subway (stop East Broadway), from which you can go to Brooklyn (1 stop) or uptown (15 min subway to West Village, 25 min subway to Central Park, for instance).As we arrived, Michelle welcomed us by offering all facilities in the apartment, access to the kitchen, tea, coffee, shower towels, shampoo, shower gel, maps of New York and everything related to the bedroom (even an umbrella). They also made coffee every morning for us.Michelle and her partner were friendly and respectful to us at all times.The room is not too big but ENOUGH for two people, COMFORTABLE and, above all, CLEAN.It is the perfect location to feel Manhattan and to enjoy the big apple.Definitely, we will repeat the experience.El apartamento estÃ¡ situado en el Lower East Side, a 5 minutos a pie de Chinatown y Little Italy. AdemÃ¡s, hay sÃ³lo 3 minutos a pie de la estaciÃ³n de metro (parada East Broadway), desde donde se puede ir a Brooklyn (1 parada) o al Uptown (a 15 min de West Village o a 25 min de Central Park, por ejemplo).Cuando llegamos, Michelle nos dio la bienvenida y nos mostrÃ³ todo lo relacionado con la acomodaciÃ³n, libre acceso a la cocina, tÃ©, cafÃ©, toallas de baÃ±o, champÃº, gel, mapas de Nueva York y la habitaciÃ³n (incluso un paraguas). Nos dejaba cafÃ© hecho cada maÃ±ana.Michelle y su pareja fueron amables y respetuosos con nosotros en todo momento.La habitaciÃ³n no es demasiado grande, pero SUFICIENTE para dos personas, CÃ?MODA y, sobre todo, LIMPIA.Es el lugar perfecto para sentir Manhattan y disfrutar de ""la gran manzana.""Definitivamente, vamos a repetir la experiencia."
25986	52834814	42310	39764942	Yunqian	Michelle is super nice! The room is sweet and comfortable and their apartment is very clean. 
25986	53181981	42314	5872923	Natalie	I felt totally welcome here!  Michelle and Richard are extremely nice and helped with a recommendation for dining and car service to get back to the airport.  Tea/coffee and bagels with jam and butter in the morning was very nice.  Also, for those of you who hate lugging around bottles of shampoo, conditioner and soap, they have some there for you.  Location was awesome, super easy to get anywhere in manhattan or brooklyn, walking distance to a lot of cool places to eat/drink in manhattan.  I would definitely stay here again.
25986	53742412	42320	28589550	Joel	Staying with Michelle and Richard was a huge tick on our tour of the USA - amazingly friendly and accommodating hosts - perfect location in Manhattan ( there is a subway stop right outside along with a dry cleaner / laundry, convenience store, subway restaurant , pizza place , and an amazing bar the Eastwood - all right downstairs - perfect hosts / perfect location. Couldn't recommend any higher - thank you so much guys 
25986	54620155	42330	10781059	Maarten	Very clean and cosy room, we also liked the general atmosphere in the apartment and the cats of course. picking up the keys and arriving at the apartment went very smooth. Great things to do in the neighbourhood and subway closeby.
25986	55019181	42335	47447205	Duverly	nous avons eu un trÃ¨s bon accueil. aucun problÃ¨me pour rÃ©cupÃ©rer les clÃ©s en depit d une arrivÃ©e tardive. Michelle et Richard sont trÃ¨s discrets, mais sont tout Ã  fait disponible quand on les sollicite. le logement est bien situÃ© et . le voyageur se voit fournir les serviettes de toilette et meme ... du shampooing et du gel douche... si si si..le cafÃ© est excellent..un trÃ¨s bon souvenir et une belle expÃ©rience de sÃ©jour.
25986	56018310	42346	39997566	Eveline	It was a big pleasure  to stay with Michelle. The room was very clean we had enough of privacy the location of the apartement can be described as very good. Last but not least we have to say that Michelle was very friendly and helpful thank you that you helped us that our holiday got perfect.
25986	56342701	42350	1260605	Mark	Michelle and Richard were great hosts. I felt very comfortable with them and they had great coffee and bagels. I would recommend their place to any guests who are looking for an 'authentic' NY experience and their place is also quite close to the F train which gets you most everywhere not to mention the cool bars on the LES. The bedroom is spacious and great for doing some work too. And everything is labeled so there's no confusion about anything. Would gladly stay there again! 
25986	61909865	42409	3532726	Jess	Michelle's apartment was exactly as she described and I had a great time exploring New York from there. It's a great room, nice light, comfy bed and lovely apartment. It's great to be able to access the kitchen etc. The whole place is spotless and homely. Michelle & Richard were very friendly and helpful but we all barely saw each other due to being busy with work or exploring. I would highly recommend Michelle's place. It's in a great location, super close to the f train and in a cool area. All communication was very easy and smooth. An all round tip top airbnb experience! Thanks Michelle! 
25986	62531242	42415	51100506	David	I arrived late (the key was left at Eastwood Bar/Rest across the road) so didn't meet Michelle & Richard until early the following evening. The apartment was very clean with the room well equipped and best suited for one person due to the size. The location was ideal for me being within walking distance of the courts precinct and many shops and eating places nearby. East Broadway subway is also nearby.
25986	66513135	42451	27133025	Hao	The apartment is warm and homely. Michelle is very friendly and told us how to visit some attractions in NYC. They also have a lovely cat.
25986	69451116	42471	58378979	Dave	Great place in a great area. Everything you need is nearby, and it's a perfect spot to explore NYC. The flat itself is clean and welcoming, key pickup is easy, and Michelle has the answer(s) to all your questions. Totally recommended for a hassle free NYC experience! 
25986	70387860	42477	7129286	Cameran	My stay with Michelle was perfect! The coziest little room just a few minutes off the F line. I was there for a film festival, and she was the best host (although, we almost never saw each other!). I will definitely consider staying there again for future NYC visits. 
25986	70861211	42481	37910398	Federico	Awesome experience, a city that you must visit and see!
25986	71580621	42486	34173134	Enja	"The appartment is very clean and cosy. The room is big enough for 2 people. The bed is also super comfortable, although a bit shorter than standard European size. For us it worked out well (I am 174cm and my partner 185cm), but if you are even taller, your feet might get over the edge of the mattress. Communication with Michelle was super easy and she answered all our questions super fast. Thanks for that! Also both, Michelle and her partner, had great tips for NYC (ask them about the Thai place!). Also the location is amazing, a very short walk to the metro, to the river, and via the Williamsburg bridge to Brooklyn, too. Bars and restaurants are around the corner. In short, the neighborhood feels more ""real"" than Central Manhatten, and we loved it."
25986	72187818	42491	60459326	Olivier	Nous avons passÃ© 2 nuitÃ©es chez Michelle. Son appartement est idÃ©alement placÃ© dans le sud est de Manhattan , quartier effectivement en plein renouveau (galeries, new contemporary art museum, restaurants).Michelle, que nous n'avons pas eu le plaisir de rencontrer (en voyage) avait tout parfaitement organisÃ©. Chambre, piÃ¨ce Ã  vivre et salle de bain impeccables.  Ambiance new yorkaise avec 2 hÃ´tes (Michelle & Richard)  aimant Ã  priori le jazz, l'aromathÃ©rapie, et l'art.Nous gardons cette adresse pour un prochain sÃ©jour Ã  la dÃ©couverte de New York. 
25986	73937030	42501	66088979	Robbyn	"A friend and I stayed at Michelle's place for 6 nights and found everything to be just as great as described. The apartment was bright and cheerful. The bedroom was ""cozy"" indeed, but this didn't pose any problems for us. The location was extremely handy, especially for subway access, and we did fall in love with the bar across the street (visiting on 3 separate evenings during our stay). We only returned to the apartment for sleeping each night, but would have felt perfectly comfortable spending more time there during the day. Although we rarely crossed paths with Michelle, when we did, she was incredibly friendly and helpful; additionally, she has things around the apartment labelled and well-organized so that guests can manage very well even when she isn't there. A warning to allergy sufferers: There are actually 2 very fluffy cats living in the apartment (not just the one mentioned in the ad). They are very shy and stay out of your way, but might be a problem if you can't handle pet dander. As for me, I'd absolutely stay here again!"
25986	74666970	42506	4192551	Janneke	We had a lovely stay at Michelle's place. The room is quite small, as mentioned, but the bed is comfy and big enough to fit me an my boyfriend (who's quite tall, 195cm). Its definitely in a cool area with lots of bars and great places for food! We tried to tick off all the places on Michelle's list.. but should come back to finish it! We only saw and spoke to Richard and Michelle briefly, its obvious that they're used to having guests in their apartment. As opposed to the cats, they're quite shy so they won't bother you. 
25986	75257816	42510	67620213	Nadine	Michelles Wohnung ist genau wie auf den Bildern und in der RealitÃ¤t noch niedlicher und wohnlicher. Es war alles sehr sauber und super nett vorbereitet. Michelle und Richard sind auch super nett und hilfsbereit. Wir haben sie zwar nicht oft gesehen, da wir viel unterwegs waren, aber wir haben uns sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt. Die Lage der Wohnung ist toll, zur Subway F sind es nur 2-3 Minuten und den SÃ¼den von Manhattan kann man auch locker zu FuÃ? erkunden. Es gibt eine Art Kiosk direkt unten nebenan, wo man auch nachts noch GetrÃ¤nke und Snacks bekommt, sowie einige nette Bars und Restaurants direkt gegenÃ¼ber oder um die Ecke. Uns hat es super gut gefallen und wir kÃ¶nnen Michelles Unterkunft nur empfehlen!
25986	77241057	42520	14044366	Nathalie	Quartier sympa pas loin du pont de Brooklyn. Le lit Ã©tait vraiment confortable, le petit dÃ©jeuner offert excellent, serviettes fournies bien utiles. HÃ´tes trÃ¨s discrets mais serviables, nous ont conseillÃ© de trÃ¨s bons restaurants ! Appartement trÃ¨s propre avec tout le confort, on recommande ! Installation de la climatisation la veille de notre depart mais on nous avait fourni un ventilateur :)
25986	78575853	42528	4632754	Diana	Michelle's place was great! She was a welcoming host and provided everything we needed. The place is well-located although there are some slightly dodgy areas nearby.  The place is roomy and clean, and the bed was comfortable. Would definitely stay here again.
25986	79176408	42532	22951804	Renata	It was great! Exactly as description, just a block away from the subway! Everything was really clean and cozy. We loved it!
25986	80392513	42539	51496079	Tan	Beautiful appartment in the heart of the Lower East Side. Michelle and Richard were great hosts taking good care that their guests feel comfortable. Perfect stay.
25986	81431831	42544	41537398	Ronald	The lodging is so clean, tidy with all amenities provided.By staying at such lodge, a serendipity - which originated from 'more than satisfaction' - in travel and ...life is bestowed.Thank Michelle and Richard so much for providing such a nice apartment exuding both artistic ambience and intricate perfection of a home. I truly love it!
25986	81833391	42546	39184247	Vinayak	Cozy room in a great neighborhood. Even though we didn't see Michelle, she was easy to communicate with. Her two cats were shy but adorable!
25986	83726816	42555	32563645	Christian	The apartment is beautiful very clean and has an air conditioner in every room.The neighborhood is great. Its in the lower east side of Manhattan.I was worried that gentrification and big chains would have ruined the New York charm and multicultural atmosphere in the last years, but it wasn't the case.There were mainly independent delis, restaurants and bars, serving food and drinks from all around the globe.The neighborhood is mostly inhabited by asian people, orthodox jews   some hispanics.Due to recent media coverage I was expecting ethnic tensions, but that was not even remotely the case.Even very late at night I felt secure not only in this neighborhood but in whole Manhattan.Michelle and Richard are a lovely couple and were great hosts. They were also very patient and supporting when I had some issues with the airline.
25986	84938422	42560	77028700	Elizabeth	"This was my first trip to NYC and also my first time using AirBnB. I was fully satisfied with my choice. NYC was very hot and humid, so I was especially thankful for the AC unit in the bedroom. If you have a traveling partner, the room may be smaller than you are typically used. It was ample for me. I literally was gone all day and came ""home"" only to sleep and shower. I did not make use of the kitchen during my stay. Everything was clean and well kept. There is a small store right downstairs, the subway is only a couple of short blocks away and there are various eateries close by as well as a small park. Chinatown was only about 15 minute walk. Probably the only negative aspect is the street noise that made it hard to sleep sometimes, but this is understandable. It's New York after all and this apartment is in an urban part of the city. It was not unbearable. I would very much consider returning to this location on my next trip to NYC."
25986	85859749	42564	76023738	Sean	Check-in was easy, local establishment held the keys so we did not have to arrange a meeting to get to the room.Room was very clean and ready for us when we arrived.Room is exactly what you need: it's got a fan, a desk, a bed and storage under the bed. It is close quarters (it is Manhattan) but you should be out and about most of your stay anyway if you're doing it right.Michelle provided a simple breakfast and coffee/tea and chatted with us which always makes a person feel welcome. She and the other residents were lovely to chat with about recommendations for activities or restaurants.Close to the subway also!Essentially perfect. Would recommend without reservation!
25986	86329309	42567	81987229	Sabrina	I highly recommend Michelles place. It was very clean, a nice room and great location. The day we arrived we met Richard who was really nice and recommended my cousin and I places where to go. No more than 2 blocks away from the subway and close to Orchard St which is a cool place to go to at night. We were highly satisfied with the experience of staying at Michelles place.
25986	86992522	42569	28071297	Jefferson	First off, Michelle was an amazing communicator. Throughout the entire process she responded quickly which made us feel taken care of long before we ever showed up. Then she made it possible for us to get into the sweet room early!The apartment is spotless and so cozy. It's got everything we needed. She made an iron available at short notice. The room is crafted for a pleasant stay, lots of attention to detail. AC was great too. A reminder to anyone who doesn't stay in a big city much that it can be good to have earplugs if you're a light sleeper. We highly recommend Michelle's place. So much attention to detail and care made our experience comfortable and a nice home to come back to after walking around Manhattan! 
25986	89757743	42581	57917277	Alex	Very nice stay in the Lower East Side! The room was quite cozy and the place had all the amenities we needed.
25986	91627456	42588	37214298	Janina Marie	"FÃ¼r meinen Freund und mich war Michelles Wohnung perfekt! Von auÃ?en sieht das Haus erst einmal nicht so einladend aus, wenn man aber durch die HaustÃ¼r tritt, dann wird man sehr positiv Ã¼berrascht. Eine sehr sehr schÃ¶ne Wohnung! Das ""GÃ¤ste""-Zimmer ist klein, aber sehr schÃ¶n eingerichtet und gemÃ¼tlich. Mein Freund konnte mit seinen 1,90m gut neben mir im Bett schlafen und es war ausreichend Platz. Die Wohnung war top gepflegt und wirklich sehr (!) sauber. Michelle hat uns sehr nett in Empfang genommen, sie war aber auch schon vor unserer Ankunft sehr hilfsbereit.Das war das erste Mal, dass ich ein Zimmer Ã¼ber Airbnb gebucht habe und ich bin absolut begeistert! Vielen Dank Michelle, fÃ¼r diese tolle Erfahrung."
25986	92045645	42589	83070518	John	My gf and I had a great time staying at Michelle's. For a great value, we stayed in a great neighborhood and had very hospitable hosts.  I would highly recommend this spot.
25986	93356525	42594	65979952	Joshua	The room was in a great apartment in a nice neighborhood. We had plenty of options for food and drink within walking distance. Access to the subway meant that the whole city was available to us. The hosts were very nice and very welcoming into their home. The amenities provided were more than enough, and it really felt like they went the extra mile to make us comfortable. We were so very happy with our choice to stay there. 
25986	95583703	42602	66329021	Jonn	Michelle's place is fantastic. The cozy little room was everything we expected it to be and more. Her place is located close to public transportation and some delicious local restaurants. Michelle was very flexible with our arrival and very kind when we met her. I would recommend her place to anyone. 
25986	96503019	42605	21782509	GrÃ©goire	HÃ´te avec beaucoup d'expÃ©rience. Michelle a laissÃ© les clÃ©s dans le bar voisin pour qu'il n'y ait aucun problÃ¨me de timing. Elle nous a trÃ¨s gentiment autorisÃ© Ã  laisser nos valises dans l'appartement le temps d'attendre notre vol qui Ã©tait tard dans la soirÃ©e.La chambre n'est pas trÃ¨s spacieuse mais bien suffisante avec un lit trÃ¨s confortable et une climatisation en plus !TrÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour !
25986	97730808	42610	60853402	Ben	I barely saw Michelle during my stay but the place was well organised and comfortable. Located close to the subway which made it easy to get around. Would recommend to others.
25986	100007227	42619	5998744	Pedro	M and R are a very kind couple and super helpfull. The apartment is better than the photos, clean, spacious and organized. Both cats are shy but sweet and don't bother us. Nice neighbourhood and near from the subway. We absolutely recommend this apartment!
25986	100544340	42622	31521834	Laura	Michelle was a great host! Very cute and cozy bnb :-) Would highly recommend.
25986	103252025	42634	1751888	Didier	Merci aux hÃ´tes, nous avons passÃ©s un trÃ¨s bon moment Ã  NY chez eux. La situation de l'appartement est parfaite, il se situe sur une ligne de mÃ©tro qui permet de se dÃ©placer trÃ¨s facilement sur NY. A 5mn, un quartier sympa qui bouge avec une multitude de restos et cafÃ©s. L'appart est trÃ¨s propre, la cuisine spacieuse pour les petits dÃ©jeuners. Michelle et son compagnon restent trÃ¨s discrets et fort sympas.
25986	103441781	42635	63263515	Jeannette	Excellent place and Better hostess !Michelle prepared everything to accommodate my late check in.The room has a small desk, a chair, a wooden frame to hang clothing in their hangers, and some shelves near the bed; everything needed ! A window brightens the room, which; makes it a bit noisy at night, but; a small fan allowed me to close the window and sleep like a baby. Michelle even offer to install a window ac but the fan worked great. The apartment is extremely clean and well organized.Michelle has a variety of teas, great coffee, bagels, butter, jam, oatmeal she offers for breakfast and on her instructions allows to use all the kitchen things you need to, so; I felt at home and very welcomed  Michelle even allowed me to leave my bags on her place for a couple of hours after check out time.Her two cats are big and polite GREAT PLACE I recommend it and will probably be back !!! 
25986	103964266	42638	2142544	Adolfo & Anahi	Michelle was a great host. Her flat was comfortable and clean. The location was close to the underground. We would definitely stay there again. 
25986	105157510	42643	85430443	Christian	Hurtig respons ved henvendelse. Meget gÃ¦stfrie. Hyggelig, hjemlig atmosfÃ¦re. 
25986	106056155	42647	77931662	Yvonne	Ich kann die Unterkunft bei Michelle sehr empfehlen. Ein kleines, aber nettes Zimmer in weniger als 5 Minuten LaufnÃ¤he zur Subwaystation East Broadway. Michelle und Richard sind sehr nett und hilfsbereit. Obwohl ich erst einen Flug am Abend hatte, konnte ich mein GepÃ¤ck dort unterstellen, was wirklich praktisch war. GegenÃ¼ber gibt es eine Kneipe mit gÃ¼nstigem Essen und auch ein grÃ¶Ã?erer Supermarkt ist nur einen Block weiter. Ebenso ein Doughnut Plant mit den leckersten Doughnuts. 
25986	106937429	42651	67717895	Anne Helene	Bon sejour Ã? New York dans un appartement situÃ© correctement. Pratique pour ceux qui veulent un endroit oÃ¹ dormir en ayant vadrouillÃ© toute la journÃ©e. Propre mais plutÃ´t bruyant puisqu'il ne semble pas y avoir beaucoup de double vitrage Ã? New York !
25986	107951271	42656	8347907	Fabienne	Oui
25986	109112056	42662	24007117	Denis	We really had a great experience with Michelle. We loved the area, very dynamic, very diverse. Michelle was soooo nice. She went extra miles to help us ;-) keeping luggages or waking up with smile.
25986	110957180	42672	95543312	Hans	Super la estancia donde MichelleBuena ubicacion y muy acogedor el apartamento
25986	111834205	42676	611886	Katie	The apartment was just as described and perfect for our weekend in NYC.  Michelle had great communication and was very accommodating of our early flight and let us drop off our bags early.
25986	112820989	42681	42514499	Adriana	Michelle's place is lovely. My husband and I are just back from our trip to New York and we couldn't be more satisfied!The apartment is very well located (Lower East Side). There are many supermarkets, pharmacies and good restaurants and bars in the area. It is a small apartment but very clean and tidy and cozy. I found everything we needed in the kitchen too. Her cats are just so cute! Also her and Richard's tips were really helpful. We highly recommend the place and would definitely stay there again! 
25986	113245453	42685	100275278	Andrew	Michelle was a fantastic host. Her place could not be any more comfortable then it was. It was very clean and in a great spot in town. Any questions we had she would be avaiable to answer other wise we were left alone. I would absolute recommend Michelle's place for anyone looking for a great time in New York. 
25986	113704362	42687	57868225	Abigail	Michelle is great. She left the key at the bar across the street and set everything up for us. She wasn't home when we got there but everything was ready. Her two cats are so cute. The apartment is right next to some food options and a grocery store. The train is really close as well. Awesome location and awesome host. 
25986	114085592	42689	32413519	Jeremy	Michelle's place is incredibly comfortable and is located in a perfect location...quite literally steps to the F train. I really enjoyed the bed (seriously... never take this for granted) and the touch of art books and art around the apartment. Her cats are also a sweet and welcome addition. 
25986	117067719	42708	8007890	Marina & Nono	5 Ã©toiles! Accueil, propretÃ©, Literie, situation de l'appart (super quartier pour bruncher, boire un verre), facile d'accÃ¨s (transport a 2 pas)! Je recommande vivement! Michelle et son conjoint sont trÃ¨s discrets mais disponibles si besoin. 
25986	117340115	42710	14773488	Et	Perfect! Very nice apartment, clean and cozy with a good atmosphere.  Great location, too! Michelle and Richard are wonderful, sensible hosts. I was really sorry I only had two nights there!
25986	120913671	42716	32655279	Pilar	Michelle encantadora, aun que no nos cruzamos mucho porque  solo Ã­bamos para dormir, la ubicaciÃ³n genial ademas de tener una parada de metro muy cerca. lo recomiendo y sin duda si vuelvo a new york volverÃ­a.  
25986	121489834	42721	34241119	Verena	We have had a great time in New York and especially at Michelle's Place. The apartment is very cozy with enough place. Everything is very clean and we slept very comfortable in the big bed. The apartment is just a 5 min walk away from F Metro, so it took us app. 20 min to Bryant Park! I highly recommend Michelle's Place and hope she will still do airbnb when I come back! 
25986	122149880	42725	99985951	Luisa	It was so lovely to stay at Michelles home! The flat is amazing, super cozy and very clean. I really loved all these tiny things like a note on the door with my name or all these little stuff to inform myself about NYC. Everything was great and I would really love to stay with her again when I go back once.
25986	122586913	42728	78651993	Sandi	Michelle was very friendly and gracious. Although we ended up cutting our stay short due to an illness, I would recommend Michelle as a good Air BnB hostess. The apt is updated, comfortable and very tidy. Nice kitchen and larger than many apts in this area of NYC. 
25986	122908862	42730	4689487	Dins	Great location and host!
25986	125142243	42739	68482350	Chloe	Excellente expÃ©rience . L'appartement est parfaitement situÃ©.  Peu bruyant, quartier hyper sympa....top top top
25986	125573448	42741	109381857	Connor	Michelle's home was excellent for what we wanted to do. Had a great time and stayed at an excellent place, can't go wrong staying here. 
25986	125960535	42743	60136427	David	The flat was conveniently located in a great part of the city. It was very tidy, comfortable and hospitable. Michelle always responded quickly and made sure our stay was easy. 
25986	126777987	42749	109126924	Sam	The house is really sweet, and I will choose it again.
25986	127702972	42755	29467621	Hannah	I loved staying with Michelle. The apartment is lovely, it's inhabitants (including the cats) nice and welcoming, the room offers enough space for your luggage and personal stuff, everything is very clean. Having tea and coffee (and Bagels!!) included makes the start into the day even better. Check-in and -out was easy, even though I arrived late and left late. The area is great, there's delis and restaurants and cafÃ©s nearby and the subway is easily reachable. I would definitely recommend staying with Michelle and hope to come to NYC and East Broadway again soon!
25986	128123378	42757	37949367	Courtney	Michelle's place is conveniently located and extremely clean. She was easy to communicate with and offered great suggestions and help when needed! Also her cats are super cute.
25986	128916043	42763	36303789	Eryn	Highly recommend! Michelle was really accommodating and was quick in staying in touch. Getting the key was easy, it's very clean and the tea, etc is a nice touch. Cuddly kitty too! 
25986	129946131	42769	114213917	Zhuoyang	Michelle's place is great. It is conveniently located to the subway station.  Quiet and clean room. Very welcoming host.
25986	130341834	42771	29945156	Luise	"If you are worried about the presence of two cats, don't be! The flat is very clean and the cats are ""respectful"" :-) they will observe you from their own space and not approach you. They don't approach you unless you want them to, in which case they might come and sniffle carefully to check out the situation. Very sweet."
25986	130803764	42774	1358277	Will	Michelle's place is clean and tasteful, easy to get to as well. Lovely stay.
25986	131528744	42778	25304972	Drew	Clean and cozy. I recommend staying with Michelle.
25986	132816233	42785	109460988	Julie	Michelle's place was the perfect place to stay - simple check-in/out process, great location, all the amenities you'd need while traveling with some extras (including homemade tea!) and the apartment and room were very clean and well organized. Michelle was friendly and welcoming and had great recommendations about the surrounding city. Such a pleasant experience, I would definitely recommend her place. 
25986	133760192	42790	21485495	Javier	Great location, great space and friendly host. Very well organized. Great value! 
25986	135861503	42800	115745994	Rafi	As mentioned before: We simply liked EVERYTHING about this stay
25986	136099229	42802	22332333	Ahmed	I recommend this place to all travelers good location everything is close to this place I definitely come back 
25986	137283785	42808	116019475	Florence	Logement un peu petit mais parfaitement situÃ©. Rapport qualitÃ© prix excellent pour New York et les hÃ´tes sont charmants et trÃ¨s discrets. Je recommande. 
25986	140385922	42823	36825331	Billy	Michelle's apartment is so super cool, easy and her hospitality was fab. Close to great local eats and bars and public transportation.
16567	94906573	42599	87078924	Mahmoud	We didn't meet Shirley but we loved our stay! The place is very clean and comfortable, and it is a good value for what you are paying. Last night we had a noisy neighbor in the room next to us but that didn't disturb our night sleep. The AC is great too. One thing I feel like it is worth mentioning is that it is quite a walk to get to subway 7 . So you need to take a bus (recommended). Overall experience is great ! I would recommend her apartment rooms to anyone visiting NY. It takes around 50 minutes to get from her apartment to downtown Manhattan ( walking + subway 7 ). Thanks to Shirley for her hospitality 
16567	96605242	42605	90623197	Amruta	The place was neat and clean ! They provided almost everything needed ! 
16567	97113656	42608	52758042	Orson	House was nice inside and out. Very clean, and in a nice neighborhood next to Queens Botanical Garden.  10/10
16567	98206021	42611	51275421	Chanh	The room was nice and clean. The AC works extremely well, and it's remote operated. 
16567	100306189	42621	92005228	Selena	Hotel/motel status room 
16567	102730684	42632	90716502	Cesar Vinicio	El lugar es muy limpio y esta bien ubicado, el barrio es tranquilo, todo estuvo muy bien, lo Ãºnico que nos falto fue cajones para poner la ropa de las maletas, la anfitriona fue muy amable, lo recomiendo

16567	103459037	42635	91407162	Leo	The room is the same as described. clean and cozy
16567	105814471	42646	58091093	Tara	Room was very nice. 30 minute walk to Citi Field. Walls are very thin, so you will hear the other people staying there when the speak. Keep this in mind if you are a light sleeper. 
16567	108816005	42660	40187418	Badiul	Great host
16567	109268780	42663	100165779	Roger	Never really met her the day I arrived But there were clear and precise directions in the house Everything was good and as described on Airbnb websiteNeighbourhood seem cool and place is quietI would recommend to anyone compared to some other Airbnb places It was neat also
16567	112158961	42678	96359340	Daniel	The place was very clean and quite, in a very nice neighborhood 
16567	112769864	42681	101662023	Adriana	We didn't know there were a total of 5 rooms also being rented to other guests. The bathroom was always in use and the guests were pretty loud, could have been because the wale were thin. I have no complaints for the room itself. Everything was clean and the neighborhood was great. Also, one of the guests ate our snacks that we had brought so that was unfortunate. 
16567	116002228	42701	52758042	Orson	Clean, great location, comfortable beds
16567	120457725	42714	103890154	Saori	Shirley's place was nice and welcoming. She let us check in early and leave our bags after checkout. I recommend Shirley's place for couples who are wanting to explore NYC and the unique food/culture Flushing area has to offer.
16567	127228779	42751	36419153	Fan	Nice and clean room. Safe surroundings.
16567	130536016	42772	113479485	Kate	Lovely, clean rooms with large, new, beds, like staying in a hotel. Not too far from the 7 train, I walked there in the mornings and at night I took a bus back, it's just a couple of stops on the bus. Overall a good place to stay!
16567	131541086	42778	99555057	Briana	The room was quaint and nice for the couple nights i stayed. She was renting out other rooms and sometimes you could hear them talking loudly. I didn't mind it that much, though, as it didn't bother me while I slept. Would definitely like to stay again.
25243	26664388	42051	18404874	Will	Room very clean and very nice. Thanks for your welcome. Good place . No problem for the emplacement.
25243	31638467	42132	9832528	Marjon	Me and my mum really enjoyed our stay. The appartment was nice and clean, the neighbourhood was okay. Supermarket and shops right around the corner. B was really nice and gave us a warm welcome. Thanks B!
25243	32840092	42146	13592596	Lize	Het was een zeer mooi appartement in een gezellige buurt. Het appartement was proper. De aankomst was niet geheel zonder problemen, maar deze werden correct opgelost. Bedankt.
25243	33087067	42149	1330280	Shannon	Great host ! B was very accommodating. The apartment is close to a train station which was nice. A bodega is close by made it easy to get breakfast in the morning .   
25243	33861072	42156	16964251	Darryn	I only stayed in Bjs apartment for a night , but I found it to be immaculately clean.  Well appointed, and in a new  secure building.  Personally I loved the shower head in the bathroom.  the neighborhood was nice, with grocery stores and a blink fitness nearby.  Overall I had a pleasant relax full sleep.  As a host myself I would recommend this space.   
25243	42275004	42228	34882822	Cathrine	Alright leilighet med god plass. Fin av stand til subway og ting i nÃ¦romrÃ¥det. Alt i alt fin plass og bo om du Ã¸nsker deg ferie i New York og nÃ¦rhet til byen.
25243	52671878	42309	13307672	Paula	Great host, great place and awesome experiece. It was my first time using Airbnb and from now on will always be My first choice.Thank you B.
25243	103911625	42637	79428906	Inderpreet	Place was great for 4 week stay. Everything worked as needed, shower was one of the best I've used. There was a small problem with cigarette odor but B was quick to try and resolve it. Host was very kind and punctual. Overall I would recommend this place.
25243	112758821	42681	76596562	Christian	Highly recommended! B was wonderful to chat with as well as prompt and helpful with communication. B's home was the the perfect place to stay after long fun days in the city. Clean cozy and peaceful. I will stay at B's again. 
25243	120728932	42715	102164044	Eric	The apartment is just as listed, very clean just what we needed for a comfortable weekend in the city. The neighborhood was quiet and nice as the apartment sits off the main road. Walkable to multiple subway stops, shops, and grocery stores. It is New York but we still felt comfortable walking home at 2 am without issue. B was great and worked with us on checking as we arrived a little early and on checkout since we were going the same direction he gave us a quick ride to where we were meeting friends for brunch. 
25243	123764273	42734	96561747	Bayarmaa	The apartment was very clean, the kitchen, bathroom, living room and bedroom, all were clean. The kitchen is well equipped! It was absolutely perfect for me and my boyfriend! The apartment is located in a family friendly location- safe and quiet! After a long day at the busy city, the apartment gave us the relaxation we needed! Don't hesitate over this, B is a great host and i suggest this to many people! Thank you 
25243	131244807	42777	50632043	Faheem	I had a wonderful time at B's place. He is great host. He welcomed me warmly and helped me with a lot of important information to settle in quickly. Whenever I had issues, he was available with advice. The neighborhood is a good one. It has a very nice gym which I used frequently. It also has many good shops and grocery stores. Overall, I had a very good time and I wish him all the best!
4082	129554201	42766	25464947	Emadeldin	I stayed with Alex and her roommates for one month. They are vey kind, helpful and friendly. I will write now the advantages and disadvantages of the placeAdvantages1- The room has a private clean bathroom with a perfect shower. This was very important for me2- Alex and her roommates are really kind, helpful and friendly. They helped me and tried to make everything easy. 3- The location is just 2 min walk from Gates Avenue Subway station - J line. So it's 30 min maximum to be in Manhattan.4- The room is sunny, the walls are full of windows, and you have access to the roof. 5- The neighborhood is very safe. I walked a lot in the area after 2 am without any problems.6- The apartment has wash machine, dryer and iron. Disadvantages 1- The room has no desk or a small table. I preferred to have a desk so I can read or study. I think they can add one to the room soonFinally, it's a very good stay in Brooklyn with friendly and helpful guys. 
4082	133442857	42788	113080291	Ha Eun	It was really nice to stay here. Alex was so kind for guest. And they respect their guest. So i could stay and take a rest so comfortably. There is nothing to bother me. Good looking house and clean room, nice location (you can walk to subway station within 3 mins), Guide book on my bed (There are lots of info of themselves and Newyork, some good place to visit... etc.) Everything was good for me. I wish i can stay here again If i go back to Brooklyn!(Thank you Alex, Kylen, Jeremiah, And bobby or Barbie...! for having dinner with me and nice foods from Kylen!)
4082	135634172	42799	109832954	Gabe	Place was great! Very good environment with tons of good energy
4082	138782570	42815	117759133	Wessam	Really I got a very good deal I was feeling like family very clean room very near to metro station good and safe neighborhood I was always coming late and never been worried ALEX was very helpful I really was happy and good value for money will sure come again
4082	139754606	42820	121921945	Nina	This place is really nice. It is really close to the station and is in a quiet area. The room provided is very clean and you would definitely enjoy your stay. The hosts were very nice if you approached and asked questions. I had a great sleep every night for the next day trip.
39921	72285022	42491	2873818	Dr.Michael	Great location in the heart of Williamsburg one of the trendiest neighborhoods in Brooklyn.Close to the M and G lines which bring you to Manhattan within minutes.Shopping and restaurants/bars within walking distance.A great place for travelers wanting to experience Brooklyn life the way the locals do.
39921	72530473	42493	3482348	Phil	Tak made booking and getting the keys for the apartment a breeze.  The place is centrally located in Williamsburg, and quite spacious.  Close walk to lots of amenities. Communication was great.  The shower takes a few minutes to get used to, but it has great pressure once it's going.  Excellent apartment and great host.
39921	72941340	42495	49338521	Jillian	"The apartment was so cozy and clean, we were even provided with a nice welcome basket! Huge TV and good light during the day. It was a quiet block despite being in a trendy area, I highly recommend ""La Superior"" for tacos in walking distance. Would definitely stay here again!"
39921	73321440	42498	34946074	Martin	Tak was a great host. Apartment was clean and tidy. Great base to explore Williamsburg! 
39921	73883926	42501	4855	Freek	The apartment is nice and tasteful. Small but large enough for two with everything you need. Shower is nice but can be difficult to operate. We did not meet the owner but with messages he regularly checked on us and check in and out was perfectly arranged by an agency. Fun neighbourhood and close to metrolines. 
39921	74251729	42504	70184522	Eleanor	We loved our stay at Tak's place! It was exactly as described if not better. It was a very comfortable apartment with an interesting film motif. Oh, And the bed was probably the most comfortable bed I've slept in... ever. No Joke! 
39921	75298839	42510	38558195	Brady	Great host - made sure we had appropriate contact info for any questions, coordinating check-in/check-out and followed up during our stay to ensure everything was going well. Tak's contact, who manages the listing, was totally responsive for any questions via txt and phone calls. Location is amazing - heart of Williamsburg just a few blocks from the M train into Manhattan. 
39921	81478021	42544	32004471	Rico	Tak's place was great- and in a good location near easy train access. And communication was super easy and prompt with Tak. Definitely a nice stay!
39921	82030965	42547	57032250	Dinitha	Tak was a very responsive host with any queries I had both before and during my stay. Checking in was very easy and hassle free owing to the clear instructions given by him. The apartment is just as listed on the website, a very cozy flat. The metro was less than 10 minutes walk away with only a few stops to reach Manhattan so was ideal to explore the city. 
39921	82583929	42549	32990209	Katie	Apartment was great, location was great. We could walk to most things we wanted to. Tak also was very helpful when we asked if we would be able to check in early due to a flight change. Downside is his landlord was knocking on our door at 10:00 am the second day we were there to show the apartment. So we had to let him in and make small talk with the landlord and potential renters while being super tired/hungover. Not the best way to start a day. All in all was a good stay and the apartment worked as a home base for visiting family in Brooklyn. 
39921	83536414	42554	78729131	Solfrid	"Very disappointed! The apartment looked clean, but 5 minutes after we got in the first cockroach appeared. There were small roaches crawling on the dining and kitchen table, the walls and all over the bathroom. We felt very uncomfortable staying there. Eating anything in the apartment was out of the question. We tried (and failed) to get in contact with airbnb to get us another place to stay for the second night. The owner is aware of the problem but told me that roaches ""have to be expected"" in old buildings like his. Also, the shower is dangerous to operate. It got stuck on extremely hot water, and I had real trouble turning it off. In the end I had to take a cold shower. Not the weekend in NY that I was hoping for. Stay away."
39921	84575510	42559	61705171	Dane	Tak's apartment was in a great location in Williamsburg, a short walk to subway stations, restaurants and bars. The apartment was a great size and had a homely feel, the collection of the key was easy and Tak was helpful with any questions we had. Recommended for anyone wanting a Williamsburg experience. 
39921	84858214	42560	73216	Emily	I lived in this neighborhood for three years before visiting Tak's place, so I am used to Brooklyn's quirks. For those who haven't stayed in Brooklyn before, this may not be the place for you. Communication w Tak was great and the check-in was a breeze, but the apartment is on a 6th floor walk up so we had to make multiple trips up the stairs to get our luggage up. I would have liked to know this before I booked and received the house rules. Tak does a great job of creating a well-designed space but the bed only had a duvet cover instead of sheets which made me feel like things weren't clean. Some of the things that bugged me are out of Tak's control and if you get New York, you get it. But it wasn't what I was expecting for the price.
39921	87256945	42570	23622107	Alistair	This place was great! Much larger than places I've stayed in New York before and well appointed to local amenities and transport. Tak was easy to communicate with and check in and check out were really easy. Oh, and the view from the roof was great! Overall, thumbs up! 
39921	87681501	42572	81582986	Huw	Tak's place is a wonderfully authentic Brooklyn apartment. A short walk to the heart of Williamsburg, but if all you want are the basic amenities and somewhere nice to grab a coffee, then it's even closer! Comfy bed and awesome Kubrik poster to boot. Pretty darn great for a single traveller.
39921	88909499	42577	1841299	Melissa	Super convenient and close to the subway.Also close to some really nice restaurants in the area. Only downside, we probably saw ~3 cockroaches a night. I totally get that it's an old apartment and it's NYC and super hot but it's not normal to see that many consistently. None were in the bedroom or I wouldn't have stayed for the full time. I think this place is fine if you're just looking for a place to crash at night. 
39921	95380434	42601	67117479	David	Taks place is perfect for 1 or two individuals . Yes , the apt is on the top floor so if you don't mind some steps you will be fine. Transportation is nearby with walking distance if you chose. The key was easy to access and communication with Tak was very easy. Overall , you can't miss if you want to visit NY . I can't wait to go back.
1306	90574966	42583	85060709	Dave	I got a private room in a small apartment building couple of blocks from a subway station (15 min to Midtown Manhattan) and a busy main street where you'll find everything you need.  Our host Manson was very responsive to my text msg and checking in was easy.  The room was inexpensive big and, most importantly, very quiet.  I felt like I had the entire floor to myself even though there were 2 other guests at the opposite end of the hallway.  I'd definitely come back here next time I need a room in NYC.
1306	93101698	42593	45483704	Carey	The neighbourhood was peaceful and quiet, a short walk from the subway. The place was clean and cozy as well. 
1306	93866275	42596	77530083	Michael	We enjoy our stay here. It is conveniently located near the center of Astoria.  We can walk to many stores and restaurants.  If there are more than 2 persons in your party, the third person better be short to sleep comfortably in the couch.
1306	117013134	42708	1119478	Letitia	I didn't have the honor of meeting Mason, but his home is a diamond in the rough.The Pro: -  Prime location -  The keypad entry for late arrival-  Clean room-  Ability to use kitchen -  Great internet speed-  Space heater for those cold nights-  24-hour store on the cornerThe Cons: - Street parking could take you :30 minutes to find a spot. 
1306	122463114	42727	100051782	GaÃ©tane	TrÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour dans ce logement proposÃ© par Manson, trÃ¨s bonne localisation, permet de se rendre rapidement sur Manhattan... Quartier calme oÃ¹ l'on se sent en sÃ©curitÃ©.Manson n'Ã©tait pas forcÃ©ment prÃ©sent Ã  nos arrivÃ©e et dÃ©part mais tout Ã©tait trÃ¨s bien expliquÃ© et il s'est montrÃ© trÃ¨s disponible et rÃ©actif pour rÃ©pondre Ã  l'ensemble des questions que nous avons pu avoir pendant le sÃ©jour.

1306	124312728	42736	98714956	Fanny	Very nice stay, the kitchen was really useful as we didn't want to spend too much on food and there is a cheap grocery shop a bloc away. The location is very convenient to reach Manhattan. Only negative point : hair on the bathroom floor, but that might have been because other guests weren't cleaning after themselves. 
1306	128409692	42759	2731770	Lauren	I want to preface all evaluations by saying Manson was REALLY quick to fix my concerns when I arrived.  I also want to acknowledge that I am probably an outlier from the typical guest as I am 65 and probably have higher expectations than I did when I was 30.  I had also stayed a block from this building a year ago, which wasn't available this trip, so I was comparing the two places as to expectations.  The other place truly was a home renting out a single room and this place is more like a hostel with private rooms.  This entry is also very small and outdated, especially in winter.  It's a little creepy since there is no warning as to the floor plan of the place.  It would really help if there was a BRIEF DESCRIPTION of the entire place with EACH room description.  Then anyone renting would be prepared.With that in mind, the main picture for the room I initially rented was artistic but very misleading.  It was NOT intentional, just an honest mistake.  Manson transferred me to a much better room as soon as he heard my pretty strong complaints. I had wanted to move to a completely different AirBnB and it was reassuring that Manson dealt with it immediately in a responsible and professional manner.  Of the approximately 8-10 rooms in the entire place, the one I initially rented was probably the darkest and most outdated.  Many of the rooms have been painted a crisp white and feel absolutely different than my first room.  The room Manson transferred me to was clearly the largest and nicest room in the building and I thanked him for this.  Most of the other rooms that I poked my head into were updated and positive feeling.  Basic yet absolutely acceptable if you are on a pretty tight budget.  I was there in the middle of winter, low occupancy, and this probably allowed Manson to give me a much better room.  One of the other white rooms would have also been acceptable if the place had been more occupied.  Kitchen and bathroom v clean.  Recycling is honored.WiFi efficiency varies from room to room and there are different passwords for different parts of the building.  Nice that we take off our shoes.  Makes the place cleaner and quieter:)To summarize, I would recommend this place to friends with a very clear explanation of characteristics and then let them decide.  I would also stay here again but would ask Manson many more details about any room I was interested in.  Oh yes, in winter it was nice and toasty!  Thank-you!
31862	45035555	42246	9930751	Priyanka	"Anna was very prompt in replying and went out of her way to accommodate my requests for the keys being picked up. I booked the room for two of my cousins and wanted a nice place - Anna's apartment did not disappoint. The room is lovely with quite a large bed, and she also provided towels and several notes around the apartment to make it easier to use the wifi, etc. The note on the bottle of wine that said ""help yourself"" was the favorite :)  One thing to keep in mind though is the walk up the stairs, so if you have heavy bags you may need some help. Other than that, I would highly recommend Anna's as great value for money in the Upper East Side. "
31862	45751662	42252	30672304	Yufei	Anna and Scott are super nice people. We had many happy talks and wish to stay there for a longer time. Our bedroom was a bit hot but Anna tried to make it cooler. I really like staying there! 
31862	46048950	42254	42633692	Suyu	Anna and Scott are amazing, we really enjoy our stay. The room is clean and bed is really comfortable. Location is super convenient, close to museums and 77th subway station, also a lot of nice restaurant nearby:) Definitely will stay again next time come to NYC!
31862	46787049	42260	28184994	Liza	I really enjoyed staying with Anna.  Her apartment is very clean, aesthetically appointed and is in a convenient location.  The bedroom is really pretty and the bed is comfortable.  I would definitely stay there again.
31862	47803946	42268	24567750	Berkin	Anna and Scott are lovely people and very friendly host. The house is located at the middle of city's best pubs and restaurants.  Rest is on pictures . Ohh one last note ; this guy knows how to make coffee so definitely will rent his room on my next visit to NYC.Berkin
31862	48224202	42271	696195	Andriy & Victoria	Anna and Scott were very accommodating and friendly hosts. Their place was nice, clean and cozy. We felt comfortable and at home. The location was perfect and close to Central Park, the 6th subway line and cute coffee shops/restaurants. We definitely recommend their place if you are looking for a nice place to stay in NYC. 
31862	49135229	42278	42896603	Martin	A most wonderful apartment at a great location, next to Central Park and walking distance to Midtown. Anna is a very nice person and well organized, despite my hectic business schedule Anna was able to accommodate my arrival and departure well. Thank you very much Anna!
31862	49796129	42283	39867042	Fei	I aarived earlier than the check in time, Anna tried her best to come home to meet me. It was raining and the Friday afternoon traffic was terrible. The room was exactly as it described on the list. Both Anna and Scott are really friendly and helpful. We had a nice stay.
31862	51068959	42294	7959016	Sera	Anna was very welcoming and friendly!  I will definitely stay here again:-)  The room was spacious and clean.  The location was perfect.  Thanks Anna!
31862	51950715	42302	45503963	Carolina	Anna and her apartment were wonderful!  She was very accommodating throughout whole process and was very patient with our inexperience with the airbnb experience.  Her apartment is just like it appears in the pictures and everything was very comfortable.  The location is excellent!  We walked easily to the 6 train and to the Met.  We would definitely stay here again and can't wait to visit NYC again.  Thanks so much Anna!!
31862	52706407	42309	25431608	Gary	The owners of this lovely apartment were charming and very professional. It really was a nice space. As we are local to NY and seeing friends in the city we were actually offered a room  by a friend as we were a big taxi ride away from Anna's by the end of our evening. This was unexpected and as we had already paid for the room we decided it was easier. So sadly we did not end up staying but loved the hosts and area.
31862	54361605	42326	3016587	Charlotte	Anna was the BEST hostess, she genuinely made the perfect end to my trip. Warm, welcoming, full of knowledge and interesting conversation you are in for an absolute treat staying with her and Scott. Coffee is also insanely good!! The apartment is beautiful with a fantastic location. I was able to run around Central Park in the morning and a SoulCycle down the road for the evening. Great restaurants and safe area - Anna was full of tips on places to go. Best AirBnB experience I've ever had. 
31862	55741273	42343	49292039	Karen Keane	Anna was the best!  She met me upon arrival and welcomed me into her home.  We both had some time for conversation and we really hit it off.  Anna is extremely personable and fun!  However, she also honored my privacy and was always quiet entering the apartment at night.  The apartment was clean, inviting, and safe. She was quick to offer suggestions on dining and I was never disappointed with her selections.  
31862	56395103	42351	48661190	Jenn	 The room is exactly as described and was perfect for two people. The neighborhood is fairly quiet, but right outside the door was great food as well as ample nightlife. The bar on the first floor of the building blasts their music, but upstairs in the apartment, we couldn't hear a thing. Anna was absolutely wonderful! She was very flexible with our schedule upon arrival and explained everything we needed to know about the building. She really made the apartment feel like home away from home. Will certainly be staying here again if we visit in the future!
31862	56863522	42357	9093224	Roee	We felt right at home. The apt is fantastic and in a great location. The room itselfnis spacious and the apt as well. 
31862	57803657	42367	2517790	Ronni	Anna was friendly and warm and made my daughter and me feel very welcome. The apartment was just as pictured, with comfortable furniture and attractive decor. The neighborhood is great, with many restaurants and stores. Since it is up four flights of stairs and a landing, it does not lend itself to running in and out, but we still enjoyed staying there. Also you have to not mind sharing a small bathroom with the host.
31862	58023620	42369	27223069	Leah	Best. Experience. Ever. Anna and Scott were awesome hosts, gave great recommendations, and we're so fun to get to know. I The location is perfect! Diners, pubs, a bagel place, public transportation were all either on the corner or just s few blocks away.We got a Lyft from the airport to EJ's diner (per Anna's recommendation) because we were hungry as soon as we got in. The Lyft was around $30 which is the same or cheaper than s cab and more convenient than public transportation with our luggage. There place is on the 4th floor with no elevators, but mind at all. We LOVED the feeling of living in an awesome NYC apartment. Their 2 bedroom was beautiful, we taken care of, welcoming, and perfect for a couple or individual. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here! She had important information about the city, public transportation, eateries, and must see/do tourist ideas. Anna being from the city was definitely helpful. 
31862	59420050	42379	3813822	Anthony	Anna and Scott are amazing host and individuals.  They both make you feel right at home.  Big room and a big bed.Great neighborhood with tons of restaurants and bars.  Central Park is a few blocks away, great for runners looking to get in a few miles in.
31862	66202754	42449	19834936	Erik	Anna gave us a warm welcome, and was always ready to help. We were even able to use her sneakers, to discover the city by walking.
31862	66795030	42453	589766	Kayla	Anna's apartment is perfectly located and very comfortable: just as it looks on AirBNB! She recommended a wonderful local Greek restaurant and she and Scott were perfect hosts.  I felt like I was staying with old friends. I highly recommend staying with them! 
31862	69304396	42470	10188418	Patrick	Anna and Scott are excellent hosts: thoughtful, approachable and caring. The apartment is very well decorated and perfectly located a stone's throw from the Met and Central Park. I highly recommend staying with them!
31862	73053077	42496	14618977	Kieran	It was really great staying with Anna and Scott. The apartment is very homely and in a great location with Central Park just a few blocks away and the subway even closer. Literally everything on your doorstep. Anna and Scott are such great hosts. So chatty and relaxed. It was like staying with friends. 
31862	74268964	42504	63516854	Rick	My stay at AnnaÂ´s apartment was very pleasant. She was very accommodating, making my check in /check out easy. The location was great in Upper East Side of Manhatten, very close to the Central Park. Restaurants, shops and public transportation are all either on the corner or just few blocks away. I would definitely stay again.
31862	75327581	42510	21624901	Rui	The room is wonderful and fantastic. Anna and her boyfriend are so nice and helpful.  Still wanna stay here if come to NYC next time!
31862	76641293	42518	2180473	Patricia	 Anna  was warm and hospitable. Her apartment is clean and inviting.  We immediately felt at home and very comfortable. 
31862	78598833	42528	72370142	Rekha	I had a great stay at Anna's apartment. The room is spacious and looks exactly as it does in the picture. Anna was also very great about accommodating an early check-in and answering all my questions. As other reviewers have mentioned, you do need to be comfortable with sharing a small bathroom with the host. In addition, her place is located on the fourth floor with no elevator. The building is fairly old, however I feel this adds to the charm of my stay. There isn't a lock on the private room door, however I did not believe this was an issue since I felt very safe in Anna's place. I would definitely consider staying here again as it is in a very safe neighborhood that is closely located to some great restaurants and sites.
31862	80283073	42538	889964	Adam	Anna & Scott exceeded all my expectations for gracious hosting. We connected as soon as I stepped inside. Their home is relaxing, tasteful, and comfortable. I slept very well on a great bed, in a room with great light, and found my hosts to be excellent company. The area is simply amazing, a short walk to everything you want, including the subways and Central Park. They provided me with drinks and coffee that were exactly to my liking. This was one of the best AirBnB experiences I have ever had.
31862	81167598	42542	35253298	Young	The room was pleasant, clean and overall nice. The hosts were very friendly folks that seem to know how to live life to the fullest. Everything in the house is clean and well put together. Location is great, and we had a great time staying over. 
31862	83313240	42553	40496980	Charlotte	Anna is a interesting host, she is very nice and considerate. The place was very clean and convenient, just a short walk from the subway, and there were tons of restaurants nearby. Also not far away from the museum miles. During my stay, Anna and her boyfriend both were quite busy, but they still provide me a lot of assistance and warm travel tips. It was a great experience to stay with them.
31862	86063048	42565	76220416	Anthea	We enjoyed staying in Anna's apartment. Anna and her parter were very nice, welcome & helpful. The room description was exactly same. The location is very close to metro, cafe, and some best resturants in the upper east. Thanks. 
31862	101335375	42625	73494548	Marleen	De locatie was perfect, op 7 min loopastand van de metro. Appartement is klein maar proper en heel gezellig ingericht. We mochten ook gebruik maken van de keuken en living met tv. Enige minpuntje is dat er geen lift is en na een lange vermoeide dag was dit toch altijd nog even zwoegen om boven te geraken.Anna en haar vriend zijn heel charmant en vriendelijk, je voelt je er onmiddellijk welkom. Ze geven je ook tips en info over de regio en zijn heel behulpzaam. Een aanrader om hier te logeren!
31862	104628032	42640	9084870	Aurelie	Anna and Scott are lovely hosts and shared with us some nice recommendations. The appartment is very cosy (confortable bed!), clean and calm. It looks exactly like on the pictures. It is a 10 minutes walk to Central Park and to the subway.
31862	106086271	42647	73006605	Tony	Anna and Scott are fantastic hosts! They treated me like an old friend and were very accommodating from start to finish. They were also full of great advice and recommendations for food and coffee (very important to me!). The apartment itself is amazing and looks as good if not better than the photos, including the generously-sized bedrrom which felt like home immediately. And having a washer and dryer available inside the apartment was a great benefit that is not particularly common in NYC. Overall, highly recommended!
31862	106688314	42650	44149684	Federico	Nice and very comfortable apartment and specialty in a good place!  
31862	111524077	42674	13642960	Kathy	Thanks so much for making my boyfriend's parents stay here in NYC so wonderful.
31862	112770699	42681	15486132	Allie	My husband and I so enjoyed our stay with Anna! Her and Scott were friendly and kind and always offering recommendations. I would highly recommend staying with them. It was a very nice location and clean home to stay in!
31862	124306121	42736	108479606	Madison	Anna and Scott were wonderful, easy-going hosts. Their apartment was beautiful and in a great location surrounded by nice restaurants and close to the subway and Central Park. I would definitely come back.
31862	130339700	42771	45503963	Carolina	Anna's place is fabulous! This was our second time staying there. The location is great and Anna was very accommodating. We highly recommend it!
31862	137777406	42811	11978431	Megan	Anna and Scott's place was perfect for my mid week getaway. Clean, bright, and really well decorated! Location is close to many restaurants, pubs and shopping. I strongly suggested getting a coffee at Joe, a red velvet cupcake at Sprinkles and walking to the park! 
31862	141275091	42827	13652845	Barbara	El departamento de Anna y Scott es muy cÃ³modo y estÃ¡ muy bien ubicado en el upper east area, cerca del transporte publico. Los anfitriones fueron muy amables y facilitaron la coordinacion con nuestra llegada con muy buena disposiciÃ³n. Muy recomendable!
29185	126659001	42748	20025582	Gil	Great host, great place
29185	127029393	42750	55801663	Krishna	Great place, comfortable, easy to find. Simple the best. 
29185	127730666	42755	17694813	Carla	Iso greeted me and gave me privacy. However, the bathroom could have been cleaner and the pictures of the room are a little deceiving. The room was smaller than how they appeared in the pictures.
29185	128544604	42760	20025582	Gil	Great. I stayed a few times.
29185	129211104	42764	111437891	Binghai	ok
29185	130334303	42771	74200686	Kashar	Great HostThis location close to everything 
29185	131510864	42778	114886535	J	Great stay. Good, safe neighborhood close to the train station. Walkable to a bunch of restaurants and the mall. Iso was a wonderful host--very friendly and hospitable. The place itself was clean and comfortable with everything you'd need. 100% recommended.
29185	133065868	42786	33786161	Edwin	Great stay! Iso was very friendly to us
29185	133947589	42791	76055153	Aisha	A perfect comfort stay private n quiet 
29185	135592130	42799	46909790	Yefim	Everything went perfect! 
29185	136579440	42805	30312044	Christian	Convenient. Only one bathroom
29185	137154124	42807	114514610	Carlos	Buen lugar, agradable estadÃ­a 
29185	137302475	42808	20384513	Robert	Basic amenities but a good place to stay. Great value and Iso was a helpful host.
29185	138319371	42813	18269813	Darshan	It was a pleasant stay, walkable from subway station and connects times square in about 30 mins. overall great place just for to sleep over. 
1281	2385418	41175	3553701	Stephanie	Sebastian and Andrea were lovely hosts. Their place was very comfortable and extremely clean! They pride themselves on making sure the house always smells nice and are very hospitable. They asked if there was anything I needed, and as soon as I asked they delivered! It was their first time, and are working out a few things on how to make everything the best it can be, but are super accommodating and sweet people! I would recommend this place to any young single or young couple looking for a quiet place to chill out, it's an easy commute into the city a few stops from Brooklyn also. Very nice spot and super affordable.  
1281	2424932	41178	182143	Hee	Sebastian and Andrea were extremely pleasant, helpful and conscientious, and their space was very clean, comfortable and convenient. Would definitely stay there again and highly recommend it!
1281	2681141	41204	3334805	Matthew	Andrea and Sebastian were absolutely wonderful. The room is exactly as advertised. The bed is amazingly comfortable, and there's plenty of room to store your clothes in drawers. They provided clean sheets and towels when I arrived. I felt at home during the entire stay. Can't thank them enough for a a great experience - would stay again in a heartbeat! 
1281	69522412	42471	32958023	Thierry	Appartement nickel. Astoria est juste u  super quartier. Proche Manhattan, plein de commerces sympa. Accueil chaleureux de Sebastian. Super guitare Ã  disposition pour les musiciens.â?º
1281	70749610	42480	2851713	Daniela	Great apartment, super clean, perfectly situated. Would definitely stay here again. Andrea was very flexible with check in and check out times. A definate plus.
1281	71552636	42486	66378140	Maike	The apartment was perfect for my stay! Nice neighborhood, just 10 minutes to manhattan and really super clean! The bed was very comfortable. Andrea was a great and helpful host and very flexible with the check in/out. Would definitely come back :)
1281	75135271	42509	52685906	Reut	The studio is very cozy and nise. locatetd in the best spot - 10 min' from manhattan and in near to alot of restorants, bars and stores. Andrea and Sebastian war very nice and helful.
1281	76119568	42514	41120178	Caleb	The place was quiet and close to couple of subway stops.
1281	81760364	42545	15736039	Adam	A great affordable place for solo travelers. Good wifi, a/c, quiet, and easy walk to the subway. 
1281	82868968	42551	17299123	Caryn	Andrea and Sebastian were very friendly and easy to communicate with. Sebastian greeted us when we arrived and showed us where everything was . He was very friendly and available if we needed assistance during our stay. The apartment is small, however the description states this. Location is good not far from restaurants and trains. If you are looking for a great neighborhood outside of NY but still close enough to the city this is a good spot. We appreciated that the bedroom had a large tv and an ac. There is also a working kitchen with good sized fridge and cooking utensils if needed. 
1281	85600844	42563	42365781	Happy	Apartment is in a good position, on the ground floor, near subway, 10 minutes to 5th avenue by subway, and in quiet and safe area with a lot of supermarkets, laundromats and restaurants.Bedroom is not so large: good in Winter and Autumn, a bit noisy in Summer season as it is necessary to maintain AC working during all night to have a good temperature and sleep well, because is not possible to open the window.Andrea was very helpful giving us a lot  of suggestions and advices.
1281	87077175	42569	80047657	Chelsea	Andrea and Sebastian were great, easy to communicate with and available for anything I needed. The space was super clean. There was a comfortable bed, fully functional kitchen with big refrigerator, TV, wifi, and air conditioning - everything you need to have a great stay. The block is safe and quiet, close to bars and restaurants, and a short walk from a metro stop that will get you to Manhattan in 10-15 min. Great spot!
1281	88269892	42574	71028460	Nicolas	Todo muy bien, lugar limpio y agradable. Bien equipado y de buena ubicacion para llegar a Manhattan. 
1281	90234531	42582	39653186	Nancy	My overall experience at Andrea and Sebastian's cozy apt was wonderful. I enjoyed their hospitality and given the limited size of the apt if was perfect for myself alone. It would have been a different experience with two adults staying in such a small space. I was close to the subway system which I used everyday to get to various locations throughout New York. The neighborhood is rich in ethnic restaurants and being able to walk about the area was fun. During this time of the year the humidity in New York can be trying but with the air conditioning unit in the sleeping area kept the area cool. 
1281	97017423	42607	2920999	Erik	This place was very clean and tidy and the AC is very welcome in the hot summer. It's got all you need to prepare a light breakfast and is close to the subway that takes you to manhattan in under 15 min. Sebastian is very helpful and can tell you all you need to know.

1281	107818002	42655	64542091	Igal	Nice place, clean and comfortable for 2 people. Small place but fully equipped. Only 5 minutes walk from the subway station,  from there its about 15 minute ride to Manhattan. A lot of very good restaurants in 10 minutes walk.
1281	110781567	42671	41142960	Johanna	Le logement Ã©tait conforme Ã  l'annonce. Le contact a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s bon avant le sÃ©jour mais aussi pendant ! Nous ne les avons pas rencontrÃ© mais ils se sont montrÃ©s trÃ¨s disponibles.L'appartement est trÃ¨s pratique, le quartier est calme et on s'est senti bien en sÃ©curitÃ©, mÃªme en rentrant tard.

1281	112291216	42679	32856912	Guillaume	L'appartement est conforme aux photos et Ã  la description. Il est parfait pour un sÃ©jour d'une semaine en couple ! Bien placÃ© (environ 15 min de Times Square) et surtout Ã  proximitÃ© de lignes de mÃ©tro assez frÃ©quentÃ©es ! Le quartier est globalement calme.L'appartement Ã©tait trÃ¨s propre et Andrea trÃ¨s accessible par message.
1281	114196503	42690	7220274	Megan	Andrea and Sebastian were terrific hosts! We loved this cozy little apartment and had everything we needed for our recent six-night stay.The neighborhood was quiet and very safe, and just a few short blocks to the Steinway subway station. The apartment was exactly as pictured and described. It is wonderful to have a main floor apartment and not have to lug bags up and down the stairs! We used the kitchen to make breakfast and coffee in the morning, and to have a glass or two of wine at night. The kitchen had plenty of glassware, dishes, you name it. The WiFi was reliable and fast. Everything seemed clean and well organized - we had everything we needed. Adnrea and Sebastian were so flexible in helping us arrange a check-in and check-out time that worked with our flights - we so appreciated it. Thanks for being terrific hosts - we would love to stay here again!
1281	122435858	42727	86974727	Lars	Die Unterkunft ist sehr einfach zu finden und sehr verkehrsgÃ¼nstig gelegen. Man kann dort gut essen gehen und shoppen. Manhattan ist um die Ecke und auch ein New York Neuling findet sich spielend einfach zurecht.
1281	138650229	42814	21226227	David	A wonderful place to stay in Astoria, it's a great location with easy access to the train and Broadway where there are lots of fun things to do. Sebastian gave us everything that we needed, and when we left something behind he helped get it back to us quickly. 
19740	80433384	42539	74915942	Debra	Spic and span, nice apartment. Good neighborhood, convenient to all.  
19740	81307283	42543	74860883	Ben	Yana's place was great. Clean, quiet and close to a subway station. Would stay again
19740	81782713	42546	35192556	Emily	Yana and her mother are very nice. The place is very convenient in many ways: near to subway station, a lot of groceries. I really enoyed my stay there.
19740	81851868	42546	72133606	David	Yana accepted my last-minute request, which I appreciated. She was very communicative and hospitable and offered me a glass of water.  The room is a small part of the living room, with a curtain separating. Yana and her family were playing monopoly in the living room when I arrived but offered to move their game to another room to give me some privacy, which I appreciated. The bed is a pull-out couch and not the most comfortable.  Be careful operating the window blinds; one of them is broken and comes crashing down when you pull the cord. Bring earplugs to shut out the noise from the street. Overall, this place is good for a quick stay.
19740	92243720	42590	54906723	Courtnie	It was a great clean space. The host was very nice and gave great advice. However, I was extremely hot, so much I couldn't sleep well. I ended my stay early because of it.
19740	94805268	42599	85160214	Andy	The neighbourhood is safer than it looks like. Traveling with subway is convenient. The room is good enough if you're just looking for a place to sleep.
19740	95975441	42603	81021653	Yuki	Yana & her mother & her boyfriend were very kind to me.Yana's place close to subway station and Convenience store(Dudne Reade).Harlem was safety than I thought.
19740	98123396	42611	84941496	Daniil	"I had to quickly find a place to stay for the weekends, and found Yana's room for rent. The price was perfect for me and the place seemed okay, my only requirement was a bed and a shower. Well, I'd say, my expectations were really lower. The host made everything perfect, created atmosphere of comfort, moreover every question I had she answered. ""Where can I print the ticket?"" And in the second I already know where to go. Service 10/10. New York is the city I visit frequently, so next time I know where to stay) "
19740	99770592	42618	84791528	Wouter	Perfect for a solo traveler, close to the subway! Great for discovering NYC!

19740	102467076	42631	22495802	Renata	Staying at Yana's apartment is quite good, if you are ready to explore the city a lot and only return for sleeping, as the place really is for solo traveller 
19740	103627142	42636	68735642	Yusi	Yana and her boyfriend and her mom are all very nice. Good place for my first airbnb experience. Close to the train station and the neighborhood is safety than I thought. 
19740	104625421	42640	95889909	Morgan	Friendly host. Accomodating. Will help you out if you need anything ( iron, phone charger...). The appartment is clean and organized. Direct subway line to city center. The neighbourhood is multiculturel and safer than is seemes at first site is you are a foreigner and not use to the usa. Only con: the bed is in a common room seperated by a curtain ( its an airbnb, not a hotel) but not a problem if you plan on visiting the city all day. Not for messy people than plan on sitting on the coach all day. Must be respectfull of others and understand the rules of living in community. Good price quality ratio for new york.
19740	106167564	42647	17398861	Ming Jun	Very friendly hosts, gives helpful tips and facilitates your checking in even when they are at work most of the time. Neighbourhood is safe, convenient with laundry shops and grocery store within a 5mins walk vicinity. Even has a convenience store just across a roamed. Train station as well. Overall a good experience! 
19740	106687022	42650	52529897	Anthony	Everything was very good She is an excellent and charming host she was very nice to me 
19740	109138284	42662	9319564	Song	I couldn't have asked for a more enjoyable time than I had at Yana's place.  Yana's place was ideal and not far from the 1 train. Yana and Olga were great in accomodating my 3 day stay, Olga handed me the keys to get my day going and Yana was quick to respond to text messages.  Will stay with Yana again. Thanks again for your warm hospitality.
19740	109893979	42666	83910220	Karla	Es un alojamiento donde los anfitriones hablan inglÃ©s pero eso no es impedimento para los que hablamos espaÃ±ol, excelente confort, con transporte y cerca de times square
19740	111542374	42674	101491116	Tong	My first experience on Airnbn and also my first step in Harlem, NYC. Yana's place was clean, quiet, tidy and a lovely apartment. You have no worries about the place, and the facilitates. Yana had to make sure I were comfortable after the first night and had everything I needed. She also replied my message very quickly and gave me good directions. I spend four nights in the place. I mainly used it only for a place to sleep at, and left the place in the early mornings.So, everything was fine but just the couch bed was too soft for me, it making sounds whenever I made a turn. The elevator was fine to go up, just need to pay more patient to wait for the elevator if you prepared to go down.
19740	113128754	42684	21042266	HÃ¼seyin Can	This place is cozy and so closed to subway. Homeowner is sympathetic. Thank you for everything.
19740	114443364	42692	9319564	Song	Yana was very easy to reach via text and she is very accommodating. 
19740	114832925	42694	52747404	Barbara	Yana was unable to meet me but her mother was there.  The space is small but what I needed for the price. A clean space to lay my head. Convenient location made it easy for me to travel and from Columbia University. Just a bit noisy if you are unaccustomed to the street noise. I'm a die hard NYer so I went onto sleep Certainly would stay again if I had the need. 
19740	115996308	42701	103876850	Alexander	Good location right next to a subway station. Food nearby. Clean and tidy apartment. Would stay again.
19740	121245339	42719	101885851	Hugo	El apartamento es pequeÃ±o pero muy bonito y muy bien distribuido! Esta en una zona tranquila y cerca del metro, el apartamento siempre estuvo limpio, tenÃ­a todos los servicios, realmente me sentÃ­ como en casa! Thanks yana! Yana fue muy flexible para el check in, ya que yo aterrice en ny a la 1am, siempre estuvo para ayudarme. Thanks yana and Olga!
19740	121491416	42721	84324538	Adnane	The bed wasn't comfortable if you're a big person. Otherwise, everything was fine!
19740	133433938	42788	34422920	David	I enjoyed my stay at Yana's place. She is a wonderful host. The apartment was very clean and there was enough privacy. It is located close the campus and to public transportation (145th). If I have another business trip with CUNY, this is the first place I will be looking into.
171	113376289	42686	53638054	Sarah	Thank you for being a wonderful host to my family. They had a great stay. The house was clean, warm and inviting. They really appreciated the short walk to the subway- especially after walking around Manhattan all day! Hopefully next time they visit the house will be available again.
171	116796788	42707	28633759	Michelle	Exactly what we were looking for, an excellent apartment! Alexa was wonderful, thank you!
171	120732880	42715	41082835	Vaida	Nice cosy place, not far from Manhattan. Good for a big group or family, a lot of space and has a central heating. Friendly host Alexandra who lives upstairs always helpful and fast to respond. We had more or less all what we needed, maybe could be just nice to have shower gel and hair dryer. Also, if you are coming from Europe, don't forget the adapters.
171	121889851	42723	104406123	Jose	The location was great and the place was perfect, as shown in the pictures, close to the train station, only 20 minutes from Times Square and 40 minutes from JFK.
171	123111552	42731	32535982	David	Alexa is an excellent and responsive host.  The apartment is excellent.  We loved the location too.  My family had a memorable stay.  Alexa provided answers to all our questions about the local area.  The apartment is very quiet, the beds are comfortable, and it is very convenient to get into NYC.  
171	124288287	42736	32046460	Ang	the host is so nice, and the house is clean. i like that house
171	127186670	42751	103755281	Helga	Great location near the train, restaurants and food markets. Clean and comfortable.
171	128305864	42758	35827869	Jose	Super spacious for our group of 5, and with two full bathrooms we couldn't ask for a better place.  Located in a very quiet yet centrally located neighborhood, and just a couple blocks down from the train station that made getting around ridiculously easy.  Alexa was a great host and made sure we had what we needed and then let us enjoy ourselves.
171	128800684	42762	75144898	Xi	Great place to stay, very clean, got everything we need at home, will be back for sure.
171	131751843	42779	109349902	Adrian	CÃ³modo departamento para 4 personas, muy cerca de la estaciÃ³n de subte directo a time square, bien equipado, limpio y calido. Ubicado en un barrio lindo, seguro y cercano a todo tipo de comercios.Alexandra muy atenta y dispuesta para ayudar.Muy linda estadÃ­a.
171	133095002	42786	71027269	Christopher	Nicole and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay here.  The apartment is clean, large, and met all of our expectations.  The neighborhood is quiet yet has great stores and amazing restaurants.  It is also very close to the MTA 7 train.  We highly recommend this place to anyone visiting NYC!
171	134699559	42794	17574739	Lorraine	The location is perfect, walking distance from everything you need, food, subway, cvs, bars, restaurant, it is also a very save neighborhood.
171	135616370	42799	35605260	Stephanie	Alexandra's place is very spacious, with a fully furnished kitchen and the beds were so comfortable. Since there was 4 of us, having the two bathrooms made it easier to get ready and enjoy our day venturing out. 
171	136102575	42802	2370789	Martha	She's responsive & offers a quiet place to stay. 
171	137450070	42809	36156783	Bryson	Very pleasant stay in Queens! A short walk to the 7 train @ 40th street. Very quick responses with any questions to the host who was very accommodating! Would definitely book again given the chance.

38914	93911949	42596	43608416	Daniel	I subletted her room for a month, and it was a great place to stay. Well connected and quiet enough. The room is big and private. The shared space is big, two livingrooms, two kitchens, never had to wait to cook or something like that. People are really nice and they give you privacy if you need it or they hang out if you feel so. Always respectful and always asking when they have a visit.Lisa was traveling but she was always available for any questions.Really good place to stay overall.
16772	58244278	42370	25371763	Drew	Fantastic! We booked pretty last minute with Fabricio, but he was able to help us settle in quickly.  Pictures don't do justice to how fantastic the place is. Very comfortable and a big backyard.
16772	68263050	42463	56456227	Steve	We checked in close to midnight on a Thursday night. We thought ariving that late may be an issue, but Carlo was very accommodating.Â The apartment was clean and as described. Just be aware that you probably need an air mattress if you have a second or third person that won't be using the bed as the couches aren't really made for sleeping.Â The apartment is close to the train and the BQE if you're driving in. Parking on the street wasn't an issue, but be aware of street cleaning. The apartment is also close to plenty of bars andÂ restaurants. One that stood out for us was Backyard right around the corner on 5th Ave. Excellent place so make sure to check it out if you have a chance. All in all, it was a good experience and I would recommend staying with Carlo if you're in the area.Â 
16772	69379891	42471	65506968	Angela	Fabricio sent me a nice detailed message before I arrived to let me know about places to visit in the neighborhood.  He replied quickly to my request for booking and answered the questions that I had.  The apartment appeared just like it did in the pictures and was exactly what I was expecting, and the neighborhood offered plenty of retail and restaurant establishments within walking distance.  I felt very welcome.  Future guests may want to inquire about the TV before they book.  Cable TV was listed as an amenity in the listing, but no TV was in the apartment when I was there.  Overall, I would be happy to book with Fabricio again.   
16772	72468136	42492	8188674	Garrett	Nice place, great location. Host was very communicative. Comes with an additional $75 cash cleaning fee, which is a bit inconvenient, but understandable. 
16772	73401584	42498	44045175	Beth	amazing apartment, perfect location (close to 3 subway lines and great coffee shops and restaurants), and Carlo was very accommodating. Would recommend this place to anyone visiting new york! The apartment is just as awesome as the pictures suggest.
16772	75015706	42508	11653525	Natasha	Carlo was very welcoming and communicative with anything we needed while we were there. The neighborhood was quiet and right around the corner from the F and G trains which we used almost everyday. Also close to convenience stores, a nice cafe, restaurants, and a Whole Foods. The queen bed in the bedroom was super comfortable which was a plus! Thanks Carlo!
16772	75581796	42512	44089445	Sheila	Fabricio is a wonderful host, very communicative and accommodating. The apartment's rustic character was even more charming in person than in the photos and it was bigger than I expected. Super bonus is the access to the porch and outdoor garden. The location is primo -a quick walk to the subway & all that Park Slope has to offer. Would I stay here again? In a heartbeat!
16772	79675091	42534	50059042	Michael	Carlo's apartment was centrally located in the heart of Brooklyn. A charming home the space stretches back and opens into a very quaint garden and sun room area. The amenities were great and loved the aesthetic and look of the place
16772	80705858	42540	28647948	Robin	My husband and I can't recommend this apartment enough for NYC travelers. Carlo met us with the key upon check-in, gave us a quick tour, and let us know he was available by phone for any questions we had. The apartment was very clean and I have to say out of all the rentals we've stayed in, this one had the most comfortable bed which is important to any exhausted traveler. The apartment was quiet and the bedroom is tucked away in the back of the apartment with an entrance to the lovely garden patio. The birds chirping in the morning were louder than the faint sound of the train in the distance (but not loud enough to wake us). We had no problem getting enough sleep here. We were attending a wedding in Prospect Park and the location for us was ideal. The neighborhood was close to many shops, bars, restaurants and most importantly, the subway. Most of our neighbors seemed to be younger families and we felt extremely safe staying there.Carlo, thanks again for allowing us to enjoy your gem of an apartment in Gowanus! We will keep you in mind next time we're planning a trip to the city. 
16772	85300263	42562	55574659	Fumio	Carlo was very friendly and nice guy. he helped us to be comfortable all the time.nice neighborhood especially there is a interesting store J+B Design on 7th Street between 3rd and 4th Ave. check that out.
16772	85461559	42562	4711860	Jose	My sister and niece whom I rented Carlo Fabricio's apartment for told me that they where very comfortable in it, it was very well located and next to the subway station to take trains to Manhattan. The apartment has this retro look which I found very interesting. Carlo Fabricio was there the first day to give us the keys and information about the place. Overall, they had a great time in the apartment.
16772	92762521	42592	50927406	Emily	We had an amazing stay at Carlo's Garden Apartment! The apartment was clean, gorgeously decorated, and perfect for our visit. We spent a large chunk of time exploring the neighborhood - we loved Prospect Park (just a few blocks away) and when we wanted to get into Manhatten, the subway was very accessible. Carlo's guidebook and chalkboard were very helpful in navigating the area, and Carlo was very communicative. We will definitely book again next time we are in NYC.
16772	93111275	42593	31534856	Kelly	This place is incredible! It is beautiful and super clean. The neighborhood is perfect. It is quiet, steps from multiple train lines and walking distance to Prospect Park. Carlo is a wonderful host. Check in and out was a breeze and he is super helpful and nice. I highly recommend this place! 
16772	94453203	42597	27364306	Cayla	Fabricio's place on 11th street is awesome!  Clean, cool, air-conditioned for hot NYC days, and very welcoming.  It is so close to the F/G train and the back garden is lovely.  Highly recommend.
16772	97454847	42609	72531354	Eric	Appartement spacieux et trÃ¨s agrÃ©able, malgrÃ© une luminositÃ© un peu faible. Il est de plus trÃ¨s bien situÃ© Ã  la fois proche de la station de mÃ©tro qui nous met Ã  moins de 15' de Manhattan et d'une zone active de Brooklyn.      
16772	98335465	42612	61448459	Kristin	Carlo's communication was prompt, which was very much appreciated. The space is adorable, and we had a wonderful stay! Thank you so much Carlo for giving us a perfect Airbnb experience. 
16772	98997175	42616	86330344	Nicolas	Bon accueil et appartement au top. petit bÃ©mol, la porte d'entrÃ©e ne fermait pas et 75 dollars sont rÃ©clamÃ© pour le mÃ©nage qui doit Ãªtre fait en une heure maximum... Le jardin nÃ©cessite un bon entretient.
16772	100452445	42622	148887	Vladimir	Great rustic apartment on a very convenient location in Brooklyn. Just 10 mins away from several streets full of restaurants and coffee shops. I recommend going in direction of Union street via 3rd avenue. There you can find the tastiest ice cream (Ample Hills) and fine bar/bbq next to the canal (Pig Beach). Nearby is a big Whole Foods. Of course the other direction is also nice - it will lead you to the Prospect park.The F and G subway lines stop is very close and convenient.The apartment has a really nice interior and all you might need. As great espresso lovers it will be great for us if Fabricio can add an espresso machine too :) but even now there's a way to make coffee - fine press. Another thing that we missed a bit is the daylight as the apartment itself is long and narrow, and on the ground floor.The apartment also has a nice spacious garden which adds to its rustic charm. Just have in mind that because of the bushes and flowers there are mosquitoes. Be prepared with a repellent against mosquitoes.I would recommend Fabricio's apartment and we'd love to stay again in it if Fabricio accepts us :)
16772	100479220	42622	92875733	Ben	Owner was very response. Place needs a bit of TLC but I have confidence the owner will respond to recommendations. 
16772	101445371	42626	26048645	Stefanie	The House on 11th is everything the listing said it would be. It was very accessible to the train and the street was nice and quiet. Carlo was super easy to communicate with even though he was out of the country. We would definitely stay here again!
16772	102967996	42632	1315120	Alex	The apartment was clean, in a great location, the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom was brand new, but there was very little natural light and the front door didn't feel particularly secure. We struggled with the lock every time we closed it. We spoke to Fabricio about it who reassured us of the area being safe, but it didn't stop us from feeling slightly concerned every time we left the apartment. 
16772	104293043	42639	8006707	Stan & Is	Le quartier est trÃ¨s sympathique. Proche du mÃ©tro. Manhattan est facilement accessible. L'appartement est original et agrÃ©able Ã  vivre.La communication avec l'hÃ´te s'est fait trÃ¨s facilement et respectueusement. Seul bÃ©mol: des frais de mÃ©nage sont demandÃ©s Ã  l'entrÃ©e et ne sont pas mentionnÃ©s dans l'annonce.
16772	105666918	42645	83660554	Evgeniya	House on 11th apartment looks even better in real life then in photos :) many stylish details and overall very good design. Metro station to Manhattan in 2 mins walking, Whole foods in 7 mins walking. Carlo was easily accessible with all the questions even though he was out of town. Please note that cleaning fee is $75 cash, not included in Airbnb fee (anyway host will inform about this after the reservation)
16772	107552795	42653	49903803	Ross	We stayed 5 days/4 nights in Carlo's lovely House on 11th. The photos of this beautiful Airbnb simply couldn't do this place full justice. It looks even better in person. The decor for House on 11th is incredibly cozy and quaint, almost a cottage feel. Many thoughtful details and antiques are placed throughout the apartment, which was spotless on our arrival. In total, there are 3 rooms plus a garden room and patio. There is a large kitchen area, and it's perfectly setup with pots, pans, plates, silverware, etc. if you want to cook. There is also a TV area with nice couches and chair. Nicely sized bathroom. The cozy bedroom opens to a garden room, and then finally to a patio with tables and chairs. In total, there are 3 rooms plus a garden room and patio. Neighborhood is quiet on 11th, but with a 3 minute walk, you'll be able to enjoy all that Park Slope and Gowanus have to offer. Steps to F Train. The Dish TV wasn't quite ready to  work while we were there, but I am quite certain that Carlo will get this taken care of. This place is an absolute gem from top of bottom. .We will definitely be back to visit if the very responsive Carlo will have us!

16772	112028332	42677	95645560	Gabriella	Ett charmigt boende med superfint lÃ¤ge i Brooklyn. Tunnelbanan runt hÃ¶rnet liksom allt annat man kan behÃ¶va. Tips: Om du har en sen flight pÃ¥ utcheckningsdagen, rÃ¤kna inte med att kunna lÃ¤mna vÃ¤skorna i lÃ¤genheten medan du gÃ¶r stan. Utcheckning klockan tio visade sig vara strikt policy, vilket blev lite tokigt fÃ¶r oss som inte hade ordnat annat alternativ. Jag mailade vÃ¤rden och frÃ¥gade dagen innan avfÃ¤rd, men fick inte svar fÃ¶rrÃ¤n pÃ¥ avresedagen. Det blev till att slÃ¤pa runt vÃ¤skorna pÃ¥ stan, tills vi trÃ¶ttnade och Ã¥kte till flygplatsen. I Ã¶vrigt var vi nÃ¶jda med kommunikationen med vÃ¤rden. 
16772	112785041	42681	1370405	Jana	This place was ok. 
16772	113948875	42688	13193992	Jf	Great host very easy to reach and very quick to answer questions Nice flat even if Ã¢ bit dark as it is a lower ground floor but fantasticly clean which is of prime importance  Very Good value WE will Come again Sylvie and JF

16772	129697801	42767	26020433	Diana	Most comfortable bed!  So clean!!! 
16772	137317412	42808	10450118	Ryan	The apartment was clean and well appointed. The neighborhood is quiet and residential but still close to great bars/restaurants and the subway.
34301	1086526	41004	1912373	Stacey	This is a sweet studio with a separate small kitchen. The location is terrific and it's bright, clean and quiet. We'd definitely stay here again!!
34301	1920099	41128	2610267	Paula	Ido was out of the town so We didn't meet him, but his friend received us very well. Ido's place is well located and it's super nice place for a couple. 
34301	2574217	41192	3556497	Ruedi	"excellent apartment and location.few minutes walk to the subway station.very very quiet.i recommend this apartment to anybody.unfortunately i didn't meet ido but we were in a friendly email contact.ido left some beer in the fridge with the respective note:""help you self"".very welcoming!on top of that, ido offered a flexible check out time.internet speed is very good too.i repeat, i recommend this apartment ruedi bosshartzurich switzerland"
34301	2633512	41198	3600783	Alisa	The apt is really nice and the location is just wonderful! 5 min by walk from the subway, 5 min away from the Central park, terrific UWS place to live and walk. The apt is comfortable for a couple. Thanks to Ido. I'll be happy to come back.
34301	3046231	41251	3279175	Chiari Harakiki	Ido was very helpful considering that he arranged everything in one day. My previous Airbnb reservation was cancelled a few hours before the check in and fortunately I found Ido's place. He was fast and made things easy and basically prevented me from being homeless. The place is great and cozy, the neighborhood is the best one in NYC.  I would totally come back to this place next time in New York.
34301	4540102	41405	6223716	Gadi	we booked just a couple of days in advance.The apartment was just what we were looking for. 3 mins from the 72nd subway station and in a convenient location.The apartment was clean & tidy. we didnt use anything but the bed and shower which were great !would very much recommend !
34301	6357738	41495	4718908	Cecilia	My friend and I enjoyed our stay at Ido's apartment.  It was very clean and comfortable and a great location, only 5 min from subway but on a very quiet street in a lovely old brownstone house.  It was on the main floor so no stairs to climb    It is my favourite neighbourhood in Manhattan,  I would certainly stay there again and would happily recommend it.  Ido was available by phone if there were any problems.
34301	6719837	41508	3521377	Laurinda	Great location and design. Everything is great---no tv, but iPads can substitute. If you are planning on visiting NYC this is a great base station. Ido is marvelous....could not be more accommodating, accessible, responsible and charming.Thanks for all!
34301	6941490	41517	7921762	Nicole	Loved staying at Ido's place. The location is awesome, close to central park, museums and subway.Apartment is really nice and as a solo female traveller I felt very safe.Thanks for having me Ido!
34301	7278500	41531	7300205	Lea	The host was nice and quite understandfull to let us check in late until now me and my sister coming from Europe to spend 5 days in nyc.. He delegated the welcome work to a friend who was really nice. The flat was as described, very well located except for the hygiene, not really clean. I'm just shocked as i just received an email from the host arguing that we have broken a door. I dont even know how to break a door...
34301	7310737	41532	4375242	Jodi	The reservation was canceled 38 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
34301	9273048	41625	2093989	Anthony	Great find! Close to everything. Plenty of space for me and my girlfriend, very romantic for a weekend get away.Ido personally greeted us and gave us some suggestions as where to go and how to get there, very helpful.The wifi was fast and the shower was hot, what more could guest ask for? The place was clean upon arrival and Ido was kind enough to leave us a bottle of champagne. Highly recommend this place to any solo or couple looking spend a relaxing and enjoyable time in the big city.
34301	18025395	41871	18816968	Irene	The apartment was on a great location, next to the red line so in 5 minutes you can get the Midtown or any other places. Very nice and safe neighborhood as well, lot of restaurants, several supermarkets...Ido was very helpful, everything we asked to him, he answered too fast, even we left something on the apt the last day and he managed to send it to us to our country! he is a great hostess.
34301	19374197	41893	7612541	Dietrich	Extremely clean and comfortable. What you see is exactly what you get. Loved staying here. Comfortable bed, perfect size room and very quite. This location is key for my working needs, being close to the Lincoln Center and Central Park. Plenty of places to eat, drink and grocery shop. Ido was always quick to respond and work with my crazy schedule. I highly recommend Ido and his place.  Thank you very much for everything. 
34301	20144290	41906	8623655	Banu	Ido's apartment was what we expected. The location was superb. Close to central park for morning walks and close to the 1,2,3 trains. Great restaurants nearby. Ido was understanding with our latenight checkin. We stayed for 2 weeks and it was more reasonable than a hotel. We haven't met Ido in person but he checked in once a while if everything was OK. Definitely a great stay. Thank you Ido
34301	20991463	41921	18268331	Pessia	The apartment is perfectly located close to everything. Few blocks away from subway lines 1 or B&C and to the Central Park. It's comfortably locates on the first floor in a very safe and charming neighborhood. It has high ceilings, it's quite, facing the inner courtyard with very little natural light â?¦The kitchen is very well equipped and the bed is wonderful.During our two-weeks stay, Ido responded quickly and friendly.  It was a perfect choice for it location and cost. We enjoyed our stay.
34301	21338233	41927	19923825	Kristina	Thank you so much, Ido, for letting my parents stay at your place while they visited me in NYC. The place is beautiful and a terrific location! Getting and returning the keys were super easy. Thanks again!
34301	21874344	41938	20176408	Sandrine	Thanks for this wonderfull week ! The appartement is perfect. Good place, near subway , Central park and restaurants. We didn't cook in the kitchen. The bed was confortable.The area is very safe. Very good  !
34301	22521191	41952	2492190	Aline	Good localization but there are rats in the apartment. I reported that they had eaten the bag and the bread inside. The only suggestion of the owner was not leaving exposed foods.I didn't leav exposed fods.I found the rats a few days after the start of accommodation. I stayed in somewhere else then for 5 days but not received compensation.
34301	23546137	41977	21981382	Patrick	The host made us feel welcome and answered when we asked questions. Its location was perfect being close to our daughter's apartment. The main room was large and rather Spartan, no tv, no eating table, and the wooden floors very creaky. The picture for the apartment is accurate, but tells little about the situation. There was a tiny little closet with a shelf or two, so that we could put a few clothes in it. But mostly we had to live out of our suitcase because the other closets were filled with the owner's clothes and no drawers were available. A set of clean towels was left for us. The bathroom and kitchen are tiny, but manageable. But without a sit down table, the kitchen facilities lose their luster. When we arrived, the maid was still cleaning the apartment and the bed was mussed from either the owner or previous tenant. When we went to bed I noticed that the same comforter was used for us without a top sheet. The radiator heating system was terrible. It went from extreme hot to cold with no control. When the radiator filled with water, it rattled like a clumsy drummer for anywhere from 30 seconds to 2 minutes at decibel levels exceeding 110 as measured on our phone app. When cold outside, it cycled at various intervals between 15 and 30 minutes. This noxious sound prevented any sound or continuous sleeping through most of the week, but one day was warm, so we got some sleep one night. To keep  from sweating in the bed from the extreme heat, we opened a window and turned on the a/c. We should have stayed at the hotel. 
34301	99640737	42618	92997711	Nathan	Great impression for my first ever rental. The apartment was spotless, in a prime location on the Upper West Side, and Ido was very helpful setting it up on short notice. Thanks!
12914	487680	40785	764141	Jonathan	Lena and Lamine were absolutely fabulous.  I spent two weeks at their place while they went to France.  On the first day they handed over the keys to me and they took me around personally to get a sim card for my mobile (cell) phone.  They gave me so many tips on what to see and do in NYC.  The apartment was nice and clean and everything I needed to make my stay comfortable was there.  There is absolute nothing that I could complain about.  I will definitely be visiting Lena and Lamine when I come back to NYC.  They say a home reflects the people in it.  Lena and Lamine call this the Happy Home...and it is exactly that!!
12914	626348	40829	1225856	Laurie	Ce sÃ©jour Ã  New York a Ã©tÃ© parfait : l'appartement est agrÃ©able et trÃ¨s bien situÃ© et les hÃ´tes sont trÃ¨s sympas, toujours prÃªtes Ã  rendre service! De quoi Ãªtre complÃ¨tement rassurÃ© avant de partir Ã  l'assaut de la ville.  Merci encore Ã  Lena et Lamine!
12914	669108	40843	1267607	Nassima	Lamine et Lena ont Ã©tÃ© tout simplement merveilleux!! Ont a passÃ© de tres bons moments avec eux ils ont Ã©tÃ© tres accueillants et sympathiques qu'on est devenus amis tout de suite.Leur appartement est tres agrÃ©able et est super bien situÃ© on est vraiment a proximitÃ© de tout les endroits a voir.  Ce voyage a New york Ã©tait super et Lena et Lamine y ont fortement contribuÃ©s on espere vraiment les revoir et passer encore de tres bons moments ensemble; comme je l'ai dit ce sont nos amis a prÃ©sents. Merci encore a vous 2 !!
12914	780977	40889	1458092	Loubiana	Nous ne sommes restes qu'une nuit chez Lena et Lamine et pourtant leur accueil a ete plus que chaleureux. Ils sont adorables! N'hesitez pas a passer la nuit dans leur douillet appartement. Tres proche du metro: en 15 minutes, vous etes au centre de Manhattan!
12914	808946	40904	1395798	Manaf	"This was my first experience with airbnb, and I'm very satisfied I chose ""The Happy Home"", because that was exactly what it was. Lena and her husband Lamine were absolutely fantastic hosts, and they made my brother and I instantly fell at home in their apartment. They were very helpful and kind towards us, and took the time to explain different things about the city. I would strongly recommend them for anyone looking to spend some days in NYC. The apartment is well located only a few blocks from the subway in Manhattan, and all the necessary facilities are in the area. Once again thanks Lena & Lamine from two content brothers from Denmark! "
12914	828290	40910	1495763	Estefany	Lena and his husband were such a nice host! they treat you like if you were old friends and make you feel really conformable in their place.the apartment is close to everything in NY...easy access and they will help you with any question you have! we had a wonderful time there thanks to them :)
12914	989593	40979	761021	Luke	Staying at Lena and Lamine's place was awesome. Lena was so incredibly warm and hospitable. My ONLY regret during my stay is that I wasn't able to meet Lamine! Just needed a place to stay for 1 night, and it was perfect! Went out for the night and when I came back, Lena had prepared the living room with an incredibly comfy blow up mattress with fresh sheets, pillows, and blanket. They even had a quick breakfast laid out for me in the morning! 
12914	1040969	40993	1878762	Veronica	I had a great time staying with Lena and her husband. Lena is so friendly and nice, and I felt really welcomed and at home.  The bed was comfy and the apartment was very convenient to the subway.  Neighborhood was fine, I walked home late every night I was there and didn't have any problems.  I definitely recommend it to anyone looking for welcoming hosts and a great spot in NYC.
12914	1073100	41001	1818606	Maria	Just got back to Florida.That was an awesome weekend! Thank Lena and Lamine for their kindness and help. I didn't have any problems finding their place - one phone call and Lamine met me downstairs to help with luggage. Their place is quite small and a lil bit noisy( 'cause of neighbors) but it feels comfi and located 3 min away from the subway and bus stops. If you're planing to spend a busy/lasy weekend in NYC  this place is just right for u. Comfi airbed and chocolate candies for breakfast will make your day even better =)Thank you guys! I had fun =)
12914	1116233	41011	1911440	Samy	Ces 4 jours passÃ©s chez LÃ©na ont Ã©tÃ© fantastiques, LÃ©na et Lamine sont deux personnes formidables avec qui le contact est tout de suite passÃ©. Lâ??appartement est propre, LÃ©na nous laisse une grande libertÃ© dans l'appartement, il est situÃ© dans un quartier sans risque et Ã  deux rues d'une station de mÃ©tro.Nous ne nous sommes occupÃ©s de rien en ce qui concerne l'amÃ©nagement des lits, LÃ©na s'en ai toujours occupÃ© avec une grande gentillesse. Nous ne les entendions pas sortir le matin, lorsque qu'ils partaient au travail, idem le soir.Si je retourne sur New-York, j'irai chez Lamine et LÃ©na sans hÃ©siter, je les recommande fortement.
12914	1138075	41015	1914947	Boris	I spend three nights in Lena and Lamine appartment. It was a very good time, there are very kind and helpfull people ( they always try to make your day better). The bed was comfortable and the neighborhood is ok, I havenÂ´t had any problem. The appartment is located very close from the subway station, what is very nice to go downtown. It was my first time by Airbnb and I have passed three great days at there home.
12914	1198704	41028	2203036	Sean	I booked The Happy Home with Lena and Lamine with very late notice, and they were extremely accommodating.  They had comfortable air mattresses, hot water, food, blankets, and then made our beds every day and laid out some chocolates on the pillows for us.  Price was more than reasonable, and they were very friendly.  Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for an inexpensive place to crash in NYC.Thank you!
12914	2373922	41174	3512181	Xavier	Lenna and Lamine are very welcoming and we couldn't hope better. It was very nice to speak with them, and share moments during our discovering of NY City. An unforgetable memory and we hope seeing them again too.
12914	58450915	42371	48340832	Gagan	Though it was a very short stay but was fun.
12914	62670161	42415	50484336	Hirohito	Thank you for everything Lena! that was really comfortable and cool place! And Lena is so kind she can reply my text whenever I want. So Lena makes my trip more fun and convenient.I wanna rental this place again!
2481	11292582	41726	13455695	Pauline	Very comfortable room in a decent location in Brooklyn. Johnny was really helpful in getting me settled in and suggesting places to explore in Brooklyn during my stay, plus really quick to respond to emails via airbnb.  Highly recommended and would love to stay again. 
10983	136881798	42806	102428944	Dillon	We had an amazing time at Pascale's! Pascale and Emmanuel were great hosts and the apartment was beautiful. The couple gave a great walk-through of the space and promptly answered all of our requests. The pull-out sofa was high-end and extremely comfortable.  The kitchen appliances and living space furniture were well-designed and accommodated every need. We can't think of more accommodating hosts and a better-designed space in all of our airbnb trips! 
24860	32922740	42147	6067351	Eric	Bedroom was fantastic and location was very convenient. Roommates in the apartment were extremely welcoming and very easy to get along with. A great experience. 
24860	34592859	42164	28069280	Wilfredo	Jenn and Connie provided a wonderful experience! The location was excellent and the apartment was just as described. The view of Manhattan is the cherry on top to a great weekend. While I mostly interacted with Jenn during my stay, I briefly met Connie the last night and interacted with her during the reservation process. They are both very nice and welcoming.  The whole experience was very pleasant and super easy. 
24860	42998104	42232	34154808	Yujia	This apartment is very near to the subway station,and everything there is so great.Connie is very considerable,who prepared bath towels,shamp and lotions,even metro card.
24860	46192407	42255	16778202	Julie	I was in town for the U.S. Open and needed a convenient place to stay off the 7 line. Connie's place was perfect. It's clean, comfy and super close to a bunch of train lines. I didn't spend too much time at the apt (basically needed a place to sleep & shower) but when I was there I felt right at home. Definitely recommend staying here, plus LIC is a cute neighborhood with convenient access to both Brooklyn and Manhattan. Oh and the rooftop is pretty great - take advantage of it during your stay if you have time. Thank you Connie, Jenn and Zak! 
24860	47275939	42264	41618356	Jeroen	We really enjoyed our stay with Connie. The house is close to the city and to the subway. The roof terrace is a nice extra! Try it out! 
24860	47845784	42268	35436984	Peter	Connie is every thing you could hope for in a perfect host: she is incredibly welcoming, easy and quick communication, and really went out of her way to make us feel comfortable.The apartment is absolutely gorgeous. It's very homely, warm, and well-kept.The location is perfect too. Not even a 5-min walk to the subway that will take you straight in to Manhattan. It's a very safe area too - I'm a 24yo female and I was walking around at midnight and felt completely safe. Great choice of restaurants and bars nearby too - Connie will recommend the best ones to you.I thoroughly enjoyed my time here, my only regret is that I didn't book it for longer! 
24860	48763486	42275	31827611	Megan	Connie was amazing. She was communicative and easy going but also direct. I felt very taken care of, it was a wonderful way to land in NY. The room was just as pictured and location ideal. Her roommates were friendly and fun to talk with. I had a wonderful time!
24860	49354707	42280	2275860	Eli	The apartment was very nice, just as pictured. Everything was clean, and the room was very comfortable. Connie was a great host. Can't beat this spot for the price. Long Island City is not your typical NYC neighborhood, there isn't much in the way of street life. But if you want a bit of a respite from the crush of people, and don't need a ton of amenities right near by, it's actually a very convenient location for getting to lots of places in Manhattan, Queens, and parts of Brooklyn. 
24860	51923551	42302	41820465	Barbara	Wir waren vor der ausgemachten Uhrzeit da und Conny kam extra vorbei, um uns den SchlÃ¼ssel zu geben. Wir bekamen auch die Waschraumkarte und hatten vollen Zugang zum Fitnessraum. Auf dem Bett lagen HandtÃ¼cher und Wasserflaschen. Die Unterkunft ist spitzenklasse! Sauber, gerÃ¤umig, und die Dachterrasse ist ein Traum! Ihre Wohnungsgenossen waren auch sehr freundlich und wir bekamen super Tipps von ihnen. Alles war sauber und wie auf den Fotos.
24860	57608925	42365	8326226	Arthur	Connie is a great host, she's very communicative and every helpful to recommend the things to do. Strongly recommend.
24860	58223298	42370	50618375	Derek	I had a really good experience at Connie's place. The coach was comfortable. I even had good privacy because Connie were not using the living room or kitchen often at the night time. Connie was a very cool girl who had cool experiences! I really enjoyed talking with her. Connie offered water, wine, cheese and breads for me! Made my New Year staying quite special. That's much appreciated by me. I would say she's the best host for me in 2015.
24860	92281497	42590	31383971	Alessandro	Perfect staying, in a modern and comfortable house. 2 min away from the subway station.. What else?
17674	30262933	42113	14521459	Garrett	Everything about the apartment was as advertised, and awesome. It's right by the entrance on the first floor so you don't have to deal with stairs at all. The neighborhood is great with plenty of food options and there's some fun nightlife only a short walk away.The apartment was nicely decorated with a sleek style that I'm thinking of stealing some ideas from for my own apartment. The master bedroom is surprisingly spacious for NY, though the second bedroom and the bathroom are about what you would expect from the city size-wise.Overall I highly recommend Elle's place. I hope to book it again next time I'm in NY.
17674	31363790	42128	1594336	Alessandro	Elle was extremely friendly and responsive both before and after our arrival. The apartment is very conveniently located in a great neighborhood. The apartment was clean and quite nice overall. The master bedroom is very spacious and nicely decorated, whereas the second bedroom and the bathroom are much smaller (but exactly as advertised and shown in the photo gallery). I would recommend the apartment to couples traveling with a kid.
17674	31664977	42132	15348459	(EMAIL HIDDEN)	The apt was great, clean and just what we needed. Elle was quick to respond and couldn't have asked for a better location or place for the price. 
17674	32551228	42143	31498884	Antenna	Great location, can walk to union square and Soho easily, clean and comfortable beds and bedrooms, bathroom is a bit small. 
17674	32847594	42146	16512169	Karola	The apartment is beautiful. We had everything we needed and the check-in and check-out went smoothly.
17674	34797077	42167	2287421	Chloe	The apartment has a perfect location, close to many restaurants and a good supermarket. The main bedroom is big and luminous, the second one is the opposite. The description of the apartment is very accurate. Elle was very accommodating when I needed to change the arrival date, 24 hours before arrival. Overall, it's the perfect apartment when you're visiting NYC and spending a lot of time outside.  
17674	35598833	42175	12384497	Cody	Elle's place was very clean and quiet.  The description was spot on.  Well located with lots of food options and close by subways.  Would stay again. 
17674	36230285	42181	34815611	Samantha	Very eclectic flat in Grammercy. 
17674	37008759	42188	6707507	Ryan	Elle's apartment was very clean, great beds, and a very good internet connection. The apartment is close to Gramercy Park, close to Union Square, and a short distance to the east river bike/run path. First floor apartment at the front of the building. It was quiet and comfortable. 
17674	39053797	42205	31386478	Sam	East Village is where it's at. Great spot from where to launch your NYC exploration. Great bars and restaurants only a stroll away. The apartment itself was perfect, well cleaned and fitted out with all the essentials. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Elle but she was a most accommodating making sure we got in okay and were well settled.  I will be looking to stay here again next time I'm in NYC.
17674	39339134	42207	856670	CiarÃ¡n	The thing that really stuck out was that not only was Elle super fast and reliable in communicating; but also was very kind and flexible when we were flip-flopping on whether or not to stay another night. The location is great and the apartment very charming.
17674	51063026	42294	30627651	Edel	We enjoyed our stay in Elle's flat, it is compact and bijou and had everything we needed for our stay. The area is quiet and therefore we were able to get a good night's sleep. Communication with Elle was easy and she was always very responsive to questions we had. Check-in was seamless and everything was explained.If you walk a couple of blocks you come across some lovely eateries.
17674	51569923	42298	16083491	Alexandra	Myself and my colleague Jade stayed at Elle's beautiful apartment on a recent work trip and it was absolutely delightful. Fantastic location, lovely decor and had everything we needed for our stay. Elle was good at communicating and we were met on arrival and talked through everything. We tried some of the restaurant recommendations and we thought 'Posto Pizza' was fabulous! This would be a no brainer for our next trip and I would recommend to anyone for a lovely stay in NY. One last thing to add was that it was super quiet for a first floor apartment and I slept like a baby every night. 
17674	71075463	42483	4304696	Sean	A great apartment on a quiet street in a convenient neighborhood with a very comfortable master bedroom. 
17674	74234358	42504	2272706	Jonathan	Easy to check-in and check-out. Place was nice. Simple, understated bedroom is great way to ease into the day. Nothing frustrating and I have no complaints. 
17674	78980852	42531	2567671	Alison	Elle was great. She was able to meet us after getting in on a late flight, and showed us around her cleverly designed apartment. We had a great time, and the space was perfect for us. I'd definitely recommend her.
33136	138617985	42814	102868867	Jorge	Giorgi and Tarek are two amazing hosts. They were more than accommodating when I arrived and gave me a great list of places to visit and eat at. The room was beautiful and clean, the bed comfortable and soft, and the apartment was impeccably furnished and neat. They made my stay memorable and made me feel at home and comfortable! I am more than excited to visit again and will definitely stay with Giorgi and Tarek! 
33136	139289149	42818	18370	Marianna	Giorgi & Tarek are outstanding hosts: welcoming and helpful. They clearly want their guests to have a pleasant stay.    Our room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable.    We look forward to the opportunity to stay with them again.
20418	85110204	42561	25684484	Hai	Although I did not have chance to see him, Sava scheduled very well on entry and provided very detailed information on other logistics. The apartment is very clean and things are in high quality. The location is just one block away to subway line 1. Overall the experience is very good. Highly Recommend! 
20418	90203848	42582	70604593	Omar	Sava was kind and welcoming host. He made sure that I am comfortable with the place and nothing disturb me during my stay. The place was clean and as the shown pictures. It has a wonderful river and park view. Was a great experience!
11541	116793309	42707	105627784	Khalilah	This was a great decision!  I traveled from CT to attend a party in NYC and wanted to stay in a quiet cozy clean home.  This definitely was the place, I was greeted with a clean room, comfy bed, large bathroom and quiet.  I slept well and woke up to enjoy the spacious kitchen, dining and living room area in the morning.  Was able to make some tea and a light breakfast, watched some TV.  The host was gracious and responsive. I felt very comfortable And would definitely book this spot again if it is available.
11541	120907088	42716	103250434	Titi	My sister and I stayed at this wonderful place. Joseph is an excellent host and communicates well with his guests. He was very welcoming and nice. His place is clean, tidy, spacious and well equipped with all necessary amenities for a traveler. This place is highly recommended for anyone traveling to New York City.
11541	123308413	42732	102923137	Merlene	Joseph was a great host .Very kind and helpful to my husband and my self.He made us feel welcome .We did not miss our (URL HIDDEN) was like a home away from home .I will recommend Joseph's place to my friends anytime.  Whenever I plan to go to new York that's where I will be staying as long as his place is available. Thanks Joseph for welcoming us in your home lots of respect from us.
11541	123973195	42735	56532444	Bessy	Joseph was a great host during our stay. His home is really a great value for the room and location. I enjoyed my stay there and appreciated the cleanliness in the house. Didn't spend much time there but it was near the station so it was really easy and convenient to get around in Brooklyn as well as to get into manhattan! I would definitely recommend. 
11541	125024082	42738	34265487	SalomÃ©	The house is pretty, huge, warm and clean. Joseph is such a lovely person, he provided us all the information needed to get to all the touristic points and he also gave us a map, he was really kind and helpful. Our experience was great! The only thing is that the subway station is a little bit far. But that's not a problem actually if you're on holidays!.Absolutely recomended.
11541	135829869	42800	60348145	Ricardo	This place is really amazing. The room is a great size, and is in a nice location. Easy access to the highways, and everything else. Joseph was extremely accommodating, and helpful i couldn't have asked for a better host. If you're looking for a place to stay in brooklyn please give this place a shot. 
11541	137153768	42807	89929797	Mona	We had a great stay here. Only thing was that the place was a little far from where we needed to be.
11541	137788287	42811	120632241	Kelly	Clean and was able to Relax. 
11541	138653224	42814	44303678	Yusef	The stay here was very much what I expected. Very peaceful and a spacious home. 
11541	139091373	42817	120128899	Jilara	The place is clean and exactly like the pictures. We enjoyed our stay here and great communication. 
11541	139757466	42820	119167732	Marisa	Always a Pleasure! 
31044	36776494	42186	30062684	Christopher	My stay in Libby's place was everything I could have asked for. The room is small, but it's comfortable (at least as a student) and is exactly as described. There's lots of great places to eat nearby, and the N train makes it a fairly quick ride away from Manhattan.Additionally, Libby was always very helpful and made sure that I had a great stay. If you're looking for a place in Brooklyn, I'd highly recommend staying at Libby's.
31044	40731914	42218	32781219	Daniel	This room was perfect for me. Quite small but not too small, basic but had everything I needed. There's no kitchen, but there is a fridge, microwave, kettle etc, so perfectly possible to make some if your own meals. Plus the area is great, lots of good Mexican and Chinese food, and not too long to Manhattan. Libby was always very helpful and friendly, and good at responding and accommodating my needs.
31044	52567709	42308	31936727	Giulia	The room was exactly how is described and was perfect for me and my 3 months in NYC. Libby was at first very kind and easy to contact (very important if you are from europe and you are 6 hours late). She cares about her guests. The rommates were nice and educated. I like so much Sunset Park because there is everything and, as Libby said in the description, the subway is just 2 blocks away!
31044	81731293	42545	16831356	Art	This is a vibrant Brooklyn neighbourhood with a Latin flair.  Other house residents, men, are private, yet polite and nice.   The room is as shown and described, I stayed for 6 weeks.  Bring your own toilet paper.  The Mug, has great food and the $.99 store has all your last minute needs.  MTA subway is very close
31044	86115045	42566	77881488	F John	Very helpful. Immediately assisted on any issues.
31044	89530536	42580	77911447	Guillaume	Amazing 1 week stay in Brooklyn thanks to Libby, I did not actually meet her but she answered my questions via messages.Private, cozy, would definitely stay there again!
31044	113047240	42683	76961336	CÃ©sar	Near subway station, far from Manhattan and dirty place. When I arrived  the room was dirty and the bathroom filthy (the bathroom kept filthy during my stay). Dying plants in the bedroom, rotten food in the fridge, cockroach in the wardrobe, graffiti on the bedroom door  and a dirty microwave (without a glass plate what made heating the food very difficult).There were no rules for cleaning the house so nobody did it since the landlord doesnÂ´t live there. Libby answered my complaints but she didnÂ´t solve any of them (iÂ´m still waiting for the cleaning crew to clean my room...) One of the rooms was under refurbishment so there was dust and paint everywhere in the house (nobody cared about cleaning it). 
31044	120750876	42715	96037273	Ignacio	Chicos el lugar esta cerca del tren, seguro y buena ubicaciÃ³n.  Lo que Libby ofrece es lo que existe. disfruten NYC .
31044	125392330	42740	816650	Donald	I chose to book this apartment for an extended stay (nearly three consecutive weeks) in New York in preference to more expensive places in Manhattan where I would usually stay.From that perspective, the rental fully met my requirement: I made a huge saving over what I would have had to pay for a better location.The apartment, as I was expecting and as was implicit in the listing details, was spartanly furnished but warm, clean and comfortable, with a nice mattress and clean bedlinen and towels.  I didn't try the microwave oven, which looked rather old, as my plans didn't involve cooking or eating in the apartment.The neighborhood is mainly inhabited by Mexicans and Chinese, there are a few cheap grocery stores close by but no evident signs of gentrification: I basically just commuted in and out of the area in the mornings and evenings.The location is very close to 59th St. subway station on the N line.  While this is some distance away from Manhattan and frequently plagued by traffic issues, I'd say it's part of the price trade-off I had signed for.Both checking in and checking out went flawlessly.While I didn't get to meet Libby, she was extremely responsive and pleasant.The two points that could have been better were the cleanliness of the shared bathroom, which was really rather dirty, as pointed out by other reviewers, and the wifi connection, which is also shared with other tenants and almost unusable at times.Subject to those two issues being addressed, I'd say this apartment is worth considering if you're visiting New York on a small budget and don't mind the long commuting time.
22014	16588578	41849	18579060	Jacques	"TrÃ¨s bel appartement, bien situÃ©, on peux aller Ã  plusieurs endroits Ã  distance de marche, sinon le mÃ©tro est trÃ¨s accessible. TrÃ¨s propre avec un magnifique ""sun deck"" pour prendre l'apÃ©ro ou pour passer la fin de soirÃ©e. Bon acceuil et trÃ¨s sÃ©curitaire. Il y a des stationnements payants tout prÃ¨s.J'y retournerais sans problÃ¨me"
22014	18428730	41877	232655	Paul	Organising my stay with Jamil was easy and all responses were prompt and courteous.Checkin was seamless and checkout made easy too. Jody was a great help for advice and getting us set up in the apartment.The apartment itself was spacious, light and airy even with 6 of us staying. The 2 double beds were comfortable and the sofa bed was too. The apartment building has a cool sun deck on the roof, perfect for a drink at sunset. The internet is really fast.Only 1 improvement recommended: The two breakfast bar stools are wobbly and unsafe/unusable, so they should be fixed asap.I'd be happy to stay here again, it's a great location and clean/comfortable overall. Thanks Jamil/Jody!!!
22014	18738026	41882	19351719	Joel	The apartment was beautiful and exactly as pictured.  The view from the balcony is spectacular.  The place was clean and plenty of towels and dishes were provided.  The apartment is about 10 minute walk from the subway.  The clothes washer and dryer are an added bonus.  The beds were comfortable and the neighbors were quiet and there is no street noise to deal with on the 22nd floor.  We had a wonderful stay and would definitely recommend Jamil's place.
22014	19330736	41892	6912390	Rachel	The Apartment was great.  Check in was easy and simplistic.  The description was accurate.  The neighborhood was amazing- close to Central Park, GREAT food options within a few blocks.  The apartment had plenty of room and the balcony gave some great views.  I would stay here again.  Easy to get to the subway to get around- just a couple blocks away.  Great views of the river.  Jamil was quick to respond and overall we had a great experience.  
22014	19776181	41900	18531842	Muriel	Nous sommes trÃ¨s satisfaits par notre sÃ©jour dans l'appartement de Jamil. bel appartement avec une vue magnifique, trÃ¨s confortable, trÃ¨s propre et bien Ã©quipÃ© ( mis Ã  part seulement 2 tabourets ,nous Ã©tions trois donc une personne devait manger debout).excellente literie.Bien situÃ© dans un quartier animÃ© ou l'on trouve tout  ce que l'on a besoin et proche des moyens de dÃ©placement. nous y retournerions sans hÃ©siter et le conseillons Ã  tous.Merci Ã  Jody pour son accueil et ses conseils.
22014	19888964	41902	3551824	Linda	Jamil's apartment was everything we were hoping for and more. The entire building, lobby, elevators, hallways and apartment were very modern, clean and quiet. Even the city noise was muted.  The sundeck at the top of the building was a wonderful spot for a day's end coctail with spectacular views. We enjoyed seeing the changing colors atop the Empire State Building. And the balcony off the deck was the first place we went with our morning coffee to see the Hudson River to the west, and Midtown skyscrapers to the east. WOW!!! The beds and all of the furniture were very comfortable, with plenty of linens. Oh, and there is a washer and dryer and dishwasher in the apartment. When we arrived we were met by Jodi, who was friendly and welcoming, providing several great tips for getting around NYC. She  explained the wi-fi and all apartment details, made sure we were comfortable, and left us with her contact info, which we never needed. The location was easy walking distance to Times Square, Central Park and subway stations. It felt safe walking in the area, even after dark. We did not meet Jamil, but he responded quickly for reservation, answered all questions promptly, and gave us contact phone numbers of local several people in case we needed immediate help while staying. Since another lucky visitor was checking in right after we left we were not able to leave luggage at the apartment after check out. We located a luggage storage business near Grand Central, and left our bags there for our last day, working out fine. We are two active couples, love to travel, and will definitely contact Jamil for future NYC vacations. Highly Recommend!!
22014	20018745	41904	18318502	April	The apartment is just as pictured, clean and new. Great view, the building is secure and quiet. Jamil is very helpful and responsive to questions prior to your stay. The location is just a couple of blocks from the red/blue subway lines. The neighborhood is close to Central Park.The only negatives: no hand towel or wash cloths for the bathroom and no ironing board.
22014	21434151	41929	3982068	Mohammed	Very nice place! Check-in procedures went swimmingly, and both Jody and Jamil (via web) were responsive and helpful with any queries we had. The apartment is up a Manhattan residential tower some 23 stories tall, so the views of Manhattan and the Hudson River were great. Location is great, within walking distance of Central Park and with a convenience store located in the same building. We received the apartment clean, and it looked exactly like the photos suggest it does. The only downside was that one bathroom was perhaps too little for four guests, but we already knew that when we booked and it didn't negatively effect our stay.
22014	21739635	41935	14507359	Katia	Appartement conforme aux photos. Vue extraordinaire. Le quartier regorge de petits bars et restaurants sympas. TrÃ¨s bien situÃ©. Un seul hic : le sol du salon n'Ã©tait pas propre et nous avons du nous occuper nous-mÃªme de mettre les draps de lits qui sÃ©chaient encore dans le sÃ¨che-linge....Sinon rien Ã  redire. A conseiller.
22014	21956068	41939	21357062	Rob	Unfortunately we had a two hour delay before leaving Michigan due to bad weather at LaGuardia. Originally expecting to arrive @ 3:30PM we did not get in to LGA until close to 6:00PM. At 1:55 PM from the airport in Grand Rapids and left Jodi a voicemail telling her of our delay and that I would call when we arrived at LGA which I did at 5:53 PM. Jodi did meet us promptly at the market down the street from the apartment. She seemed somewhat disgruntled and put out by our delay and informed us we would owe her a $25 late arrival fee. The listing was very accurate and it was in a nice part of the city. 
22014	22183196	41944	20233697	Susan	The apartment was great.  We stayed here with another couple and found that the space was cozy and the view was breath taking.  I hadn't realized that one of the rooms is without a door but we made do with what we had.  Jody was gracious and we had no trouble meeting her up at all.  Jamil would always be quick to respond to any questions or concerns that I may have.  I certainly bugged him a lot being that this was my first experience.  The apartment was high enough where we weren't bothered by the street noise at all.  Everything was very convenient.  We walked everyday and took the subway which is only a couple of blocks away to any of the lines.  The place was clean and everything worked just fine.  The washer and dryer were a major plus.  There is a parking garage right behind the apartment that you could park in and there are street parking available if you abide by the times posted.  We had no trouble with that at all.  A couple of things that could have been trouble was the shower curtain needed to be replaced or cleaned, the coffee pot seemed to leak, and the bedspread in the doorless room always seemed to come undone perhaps because it's not quite the right size but they were so minor that it didn't bother us enough to call or bother Jamil or Jody.  I would DEFINATELY stay here again and recommend it to others that plan to take a trip there.  THANKS!
22014	22955339	41961	22638078	Melinda	Great communication, everything very organised which we loved!
22014	23157702	41967	21877380	Brad	We were 4 friends travelling to NYC for theatre and shopping. Good location 10 minute walk to Times Square.  Nice apt, quiet, great view of Hudson River. Strict checkin out times to be clearly confirmed before booking. We would stay again.
22014	24021232	41990	19930307	Kendra	We were EXTREMELY happy about staying in this apartment for our visit!  The apartment looks exactly as pictured. Clean. Beautiful. The view at dusk and at night is GORGEOUS!  The building itself is new and the nicest on the block.All linens were provided as well as glasses, mugs, etc. Each room was a good size and the bathroom was as well. There were 3 keys, so we didn't have to keep meeting up to give someone else the key.The location is great, just a couple blocks from the subway and we walked to Time Square, Rockefeller Center and tons of other places from the apartment. It was close enough that if we wanted to go back and freshen up or change, it was super easy. My husband actually hurt his back 2 days before our trip, so we were so thankful to have such a nice space where he could relax and enjoy the apartment when he wasn't able to go out walking with us. Also Jamil and Jody were able to accommodate a late checkout for us since no one was coming that day. It was amazing and hope to rent again! If you stay here, we would recommend eating at Stecchino just around the corner. Great food, great atmosphere! Also the little bakery across the street, La Bergamote, had great desserts! 
22014	25748091	42029	3551824	Linda	This was our second visit, and once again we had a fabulous stay. The apartment is very clean, comfortably appointed and the views are exceptional. Nearby deli and bakery with yummy breakfast pastry. The neighborhood feels safe, and we were able to walk everywhere, at any hour. Checked out Julliard School of Music for some wonderful performances with low or no admission. Jody was easy to contact, and very helpful and welcoming. You can pack light, as there is a washer and dryer right in the apartment. Hairdryer is also provided. Lots of towels, comfortable beds. Enjoy!
22014	27885529	42077	6168528	Margaux	Great location, beautiful view, great lobby and gym. The condo was not clean though and our host (not Jamil) not very helpful nor available for requests. Missing dishcloths and pods in the kitchen. No door in one of the bedroom. 
22014	28298744	42085	3201815	Pablo Fernando	We had a great time in NY. The apartment has a fantastic view, and is very comfortable, exactly like the pictures posted. Highly recommended!
22014	28530631	42088	16135261	Gianluca	The experience in New York city was great. We don't direcly met with the host, but with a friend of him that was very polite and explained everything that we needed to know. The apartment was very clean. The view from that apartment is really wonderful on both day and night. 
22014	29045292	42097	27333845	Nicole	Jamil's apartment was perfect for our family of 5.  It looks exactly like the pictures, no unwanted surprises.  We slept in one room, two kids slept in the other and the third slept comfortably on the couch.  Jody met us and was supremely helpful, showing us around the apartment and giving us a list of useful apps to help us navigate the city.  Plenty of clean sheets, blankets and towels.  The location was perfect for us and allowed us easy access to Times Square without being right in the middle of it.  We heard no noise from neighbors and very little street noise.  The balcony provided a beautiful view, and the rooftop sun deck was even better!  We would absolutely stay here again.
22014	30148768	42112	11466830	Philipp	Jamil & Jody were amazing hosts!The whole check in process was very smooth even though we arrived pretty late. We reached Jody instantly, she gave us a warm welcome and provided us with some really useful tips regarding public transportation and restaurants nearby. The apartment is exactly as pictured, the balcony with a view on the Hudson river is breathtaking and the whole building seemed very clean and secure. Thank you for an unforgettable time in NY!
22014	31108058	42126	29177223	Federica	Even if the apartment is very nice, the views from the balcony are amazing and the location is great ( 10 minutes walk to Times square and Central Park), this is not suitable for 6 people because the sofa bed is very small and unconfortable, so there are only two beds where settle 4 people. Sheets, blankets and towels provided were dirty and only a towel per person is not enough. At the arrival at JFK we were always in contact with host to advise of our late because of an unexpected long passport control procedure. In the  e-mail that Jamil sent with all informations and details of our reservation, he specified that eccessive wait time without warning  would result in additional charges ( 25$ per hour). Despite of our constant warning about the late, at our check in we had to pay 50 $ as additional charge for excessive waiting, anyways. As we asked him the reason, he didn't give us any explanation with rude behavior. Not good experience with this host and airbnb.
22014	31762319	42134	25405093	Gilles	appartement bien situÃ©, agrÃ©able avec une vue magnifique. Accueil correct sans plus; il faut dire que notre arrivÃ©e Ã©tait un peu tardive.la propretÃ© n'est pas au top (ne regardez pas sous les lits). La quantitÃ© de vaisselle n'est pas tout Ã  fait suffisante, la planche Ã  repasser absente; mais ce sont des dÃ©tails facilement modifiable et peu important compte tenu du sÃ©jour plutÃ´t agrÃ©able
22014	31961258	42136	20516703	Doris	My English is not good, so use the (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) translation. Same as the before  customers,We be charged $175 late fine. Not that we do not abide by the rules, but AIRBNB customers from around the world, in various languages, a lot of English is not particularly good, it would be difficult to read a great article in the e-mail in English, several times since it has been such a unhappy event occurred , ask the landlord the next customer to your book when informed of this fine case personally to avoid unnecessary disputes! And this time we travel in the US more than 20 AIRBNB, basically keys in a certain place on the line, your house and other house we stayed in, like, almost the rule,You do not need to have someone in there, turn-key to us. If you have to so that we prefer to pick up the keys to her place, stronger than was fined $175. We know that will be charged after the highway opened quickly, very dangerous, could have been avoided thing, next time when someone booking your landlord personally clear to avoid unpleasantness
22014	32709989	42144	17599286	Huijuan	Nice cozy,clean room,and comfortable bed.good location in New York City,close to Time Squares,and have great view form balcony,this is a surprise.Jamil is a warm host,he prepared everything we need.We have a wonderful experience in NYC.
22014	38042849	42197	34227738	Mikhail	Check-in procedure was convenient and smooth; host arranged an easy meet-up with delegate nearby. She was responsive, friendly, and informative.Apartment was very clean and had a cool view. Pictures accurately reflect the space. I would note, however, though it is 2-bdr, one of those bedrooms does not have a door, but only an open doorway onto the main area. This is a reasonable description in NYC, and fine for my own travel, but something to be aware of for any privacy-concerned individuals.Neighborhood was fine - very convenient for going to a wide variety of places in the city.
22014	38713813	42203	14983978	Sarah	The communication with Jamil and then Massy was great. When we arrived at the apartment it was as describe, we stayed there for 6 nights and it was perfect. The location is perfect to visit principals attractions, few block from Central Park and time square. The view is speechless , you must try the sun deck. We were 3 and had a blast, I highly recommend this place. There are plenty of restaurant nearby. Thank you.
22014	39005871	42205	15244588	Ashley	Jamil's place was perfect for our girls' weekend.  The view & balcony are incredible.  Jamil's friend greeted us & was very responsive.
22014	41315483	42223	6794267	Susan	Was very happy with the apartment - perfect location - great views - comfortable beds.  Would definitely recommend this place.   Was disappointed when the door to the balcony didn't open but the rooftop garden made up for this!  Great escape in the heart of the city.  
22014	42114526	42227	8998962	Michael	The Host was very friendly and professional. He was very helpful in answering any questions I had about checkin and transportation to the apartment. The apartment was great. It was very clean and had an extraordinary view of the city and the river. Overall great experience, we had a wonderful time and would definitely come back in the future. 
22014	43157494	42233	708821	Graeme	Wonderful apartment perfect for a NYC weekend. There were three of us and the apartment worked just fine. Great neighborhood and a beautiful building and perfect location for all the Hells Kitchen nightlife. The second bedroom does not have a door and it doesn't receive much a/c so it's a bit warmer in there but the living room couch is very comfy. Jamil takes his house rules very seriously and charged us $50.00 because our train was scheduled to arrive late in the evening even though we communicated our schedule up front. We even arrived earlier than scheduled (9:30) and we're still charged the fee for arriving after 10:00pm ($50). 
22014	45967073	42254	38344989	Brian	The condo was great.  Awesome location, with a great layout and beautiful views of NYC. Would definitely recommend and stay again. 
22014	46728678	42260	39047571	Marie	Jamil was always quick to respond to my inquiries and very thorough with info re: his property.  Massy met us at the assgned. location and graciously gave a a tour of the apt.   The apt is in a great location with lots of restaurants and even food market a blockaway.  The sundeck is spectacular as is the terrace.  the apt was very roomy for the 3 of us..a nice place to relax and visit after our hectic days.  This was a very positive FIRST experience with Airbnb!!!
22014	47277222	42264	35625539	Clare	Spacious and clean apartment with great views across the city. Massiel was really friendly and helpful when we met her to collect the keys. The apartment is in a great area - walkable to Times Square, Rockefeller, the park and a handy spot to pick up a taxi for further afield. And lots of good bars and restaurants nearby.Worth a trip up to the roof terrace to see the Empire State building lit up at night!
22014	47672828	42268	39253986	Laura	The location was great.. The view was great... Apartment was clean.. Could use a few more ammentities in the kitchen. My check in went well.. and everyone I came into contact with was very nice.
22014	48315081	42272	43327416	Stephen	"Good apartment in a nice part of town with great views. But be careful about the ""late fees"" that you may be charged with. In our case we were told to be there by 6pm - we there an hour earlier but the apartment was still being cleaned. And we were expected to pay a $25 late fee for turning up at the time we were told. We were actually early and were waiting an hour in the street for the apartment to be ready. I suggested they should have paid me the late fee for keeping me waiting for an hour. When I refused to pay the ridiculous late fee I was threatened with a negative AirBNB review. And make sure he doesn't take the extra $25 out of the security deposit that's held on your credit card. It's a pity we had to deal with this rubbish - spoiled our New York arrival and affected my whole experience and made it good not great."
22014	49112718	42278	33829223	Abdulrahman	Was great experience. Thanks Jamil for your hospitality  
22014	49783498	42283	41371407	Jessica	Great area. We enjoyed the apartment a lot and loved that we had a balcony. 
22014	50096792	42286	41566560	Kathleen	The neighborhood was safe and comfortable.  The apartment was attractive and the furnishings adequate.  Would book it again.
22014	50624802	42290	38991496	Wolfgang	Very good apartment in good location in Manhattan. Beautiful  view especially from the sky deck (roof terrace) at night. Check-in and check-out without any problems. The key handover work perfect on the meeting point. Due to a massive rain shower the dryer was very helpful  I would book it againâ?¦â?¦Greeting from Germany
22014	55667035	42342	9402628	Pia	"AuÃ?er der hervorragenden Lage und dem fantastischen Blick war der Aufenthalt eine herbe EnttÃ¤uschung: Die Wohnung ist abgewohnt (Kofferspuren an allen WÃ¤nden, fleckiger Teppich und Matratze), schlecht geputzt (dicke Staubflocken im LÃ¼ftungsgitter vom Bad, klebriger KÃ¼hlschrank) und schlecht ausgestattet (zwei Barhocker fÃ¼r drei Leute, angeschlagenes Geschirr - kaum genug, um die SpÃ¼lmaschine zu fÃ¼llen). Dass das kleinere Schlafzimmer keine TÃ¼r hat, geht aus den Bildern klar hervor, dass aber der KÃ¼hlschrank direkt daneben ist und die ganze Nacht GerÃ¤usche macht, geben die Fotos aus der ""luxuriÃ¶sen Vergangenheit"" der Wohnung nicht her. Der Kontakt zu Jamil funktioniert nur, solange er etwas von uns (Geld) will. Als kleines Beispiel verkÃ¼ndete er bei der Durchgabe der Ankunftszeit (16.00 Uhr Inlandsflug), dass wir auf jeden Fall nach 18.00 Uhr ankÃ¤men und 25 Dollar zu zahlen hÃ¤tten. TatsÃ¤chlich waren wir um 17.20 Uhr da. Die schlecht zu erreichende Franzeska Ã¼bergibt lediglich die SchlÃ¼ssel. Die HandttÃ¼cher waren bei der Ankunft noch im Trockner. Als wir sie herausnahmen, waren einige noch voller Make-up Flecken. Als wir Jamil darÃ¼ber informierten, schrieb er nur, dass niemand schmutzige HandtÃ¼cher in den Trockner gebe...Der Gipfel war aber, dass man uns am vorletzten Tag den Strom abstellte, weil Jamil die Stromrechnung nicht bezahlt hatte. Wir saÃ?en ohne Licht und Heizung da, bis airbnb irgendwie erwirkte, dass der Strom wieder angeschaltet wurde. Herzlichen Dank! Jamil war in dieser Situation nicht zu sprechen. Lediglich die Mitteilung per Mail (wir hatten ohne Strom aber auch kein Internet) erreichte uns am anderen Tag, dass er geglaubt habe, der Strom werde automatisch abgebucht.NatÃ¼rlich geht aus dem restriktiven Reglement, das man bei getÃ¤tigter Buchung zur Kenntnis zu nehmen hat, deutlich hervor, dass es sich hier nicht um einen individuellen Aufenthalt ""zu Hause bei Freunden"" handeln kann. Das erwartet auch niemand in einer Stadt wie NY, aber dies war bisher der unangenehmste Aufenthalt, den ich Ã¼ber airbnb erlebt habe. Das Krisenmanagement von airbnb ist allerdings hervorragend!"
22014	56019117	42346	1574086	Sheri	We had the most amazing time in NYC and to start it off was a smooth and easy arrival to this beautiful apartment.  The check in was seamless, no difficulties at all.  The apartment is wonderful, the perfect home base while exploring the city.  The views are fantastic...after coming home each night myself and three girlfriends would turn off all the lights and sit, just taking in the city lights.  It was wonderful having a balcony to drink coffee on each morning. The roof deck is incredible as well with views around the entire city.  Great experience...thank you Jamil.      
22014	57836388	42367	21331213	Allison	This is a great, contemporary, clean apt.  It has 2 bedrooms (one has no door) a living room, kitchen and bath.  The view is utterly NY and beautiful!The location is about 8 easy blocks from Times Square, 3 blocks to theaters and surrounded by great restaurants.  I heartily rec Jamil's apt!  ( I never met Jamil, but Fabian, his asst, was wonderful!  I had a problem with the door and Fabian was very responsive.)Perfect rental.
22014	58651663	42372	51236474	Steeve	The appartment was as described. No bad surprises, the view was amazing, there was tea and coffee in the kitchen for the breakfast. apartment was clean.We appreciated the location, safe, only two blocks from the subway, lots of restaurants and food stores nearby. The person of contact was on time and check-in went perfectly well. Just a little misunderstanding regarding the checkout time as we agreed to leave on 2pm with the person of contact who didn't informed Jamil. So we had to leave in a bit of hurry in the morning. But Jamil was quick to answer so we managed it well, not a big deal it can happen.Good experience for the first time with Airbnb
22014	59011135	42374	47666778	David	Jamil was a great host. We met his assistant at the assigned check-in time and had no issues getting into the apartment. The pictures of the apartment are completely accurate. We had our original Airbnb cancelled by the host the day before we were to check-in, but thankfully for us, Jamil was quick to respond and pre-approved us right away. We are so happy our other room was cancelled because Jamil's place was incredible. If you want unobstructed views of the city, this place is for you! The views from the room and the sun deck were perfect. I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone who wants a great location and great views. 
22014	59524649	42380	25272499	Michael	Jamil's apartment was a great find. My guests and I had a great time and we had plenty of room as this was a massive apartment by NY standards. Jamil was not a very involved host so keep that in mind if you are looking for one. Also, considering how much you pay for a cleaning fee, you have to do a lot of cleaning per his instructions for check-out. That being said, Jamil was very accommodating of both an early check-in and a change in the number of guests staying at his apartment.
22014	59727995	42383	38174771	Nadav	Amazing apartment. Worths a every penny. 
22014	60409132	42392	53450710	Felipe	Tuvimos una estadÃ­a excelente. El departamento resulto muy cÃ³modo, con una vista asombrosa. El barrio es muy tranquilo y seguro. Sin dudas volverÃ­a a hospedarme allÃ­. 
22014	60856552	42397	3757845	Perry	Great location, excellent views and a very nice building with doorman and upscale feel. Unit is very comfortable and pretty well appointed.
22014	61914667	42409	46203958	Paul	My family had a wonderful time in Jamil's apartment. The view at night was spectacular. We had the most amazing rich orange/red sunset which was also a treat. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. While we did not meet Jamil, check in was a breeze. Jamil was extremely accommodating around the check in time. We had multiple changes to our arrival due to weather and kids commitments but Jamil was fine with it all. Well recommended.
22014	63456887	42423	44420993	Sarah	Jamil's apartment does not disappoint! It looks exactly like the photos, and the terrace view is really breathtaking. Jamil was very responsive and accommodating. I definitely recommend him and his apartment!
22014	64170246	42429	24101513	Ero-Orez	Jamie's place is cozy and cool, especially the amazing view from the balcony. Jamil is so kind, and we all had a good time in New York! Hope to come again.
22014	64845673	42437	30304343	Erik	The apartment has everything you need, a super nice master bedroom with an awesome view of the city, and a spacious balcony with a view of the hudson. The place is nice and clean without too much stuff to get in your way, and the sofa bed comfortable. It's really close to alot of midtown's attractions, and the host was courteous and quick to respond to any questions. I will definately stay here again, if possible.
22014	65393863	42442	3515666	Kevin	This was an awesome spot. Really smooth integration with Jamil and would definitely recommend. Beautiful building. Clean unit. Epic view and balcony. This will be my rental of choice on future trips back to the city. 
22014	66979320	42455	24488383	Carolina	We had a great experience in NYC. The apartment was in a great location, walking distance to train or to get to Times Square area. It was well furnished and comfortable. We had some issues with the clothes dryer, but Jamil was very proactive on trying to solve it and then giving us other options in order for us to have access to a dryer and cover the cost, when the one in the apartment couldn't be fixed during our stay. My whole family really enjoyed the week in NYC. 
22014	67581301	42459	27599904	Mitchell	Great location for Broadway or Lincoln Center.  Wonderful modern building with a roof deck and balcony with great views.  Easy check in, very comfortable for four people.  No problems, would stay there again.
22014	71725143	42488	61721714	Leonid	This apartment was like the picture on Airbnb. Only things to note were that the second bedroom did not have a door. Also the beds are on slats and one of the beds kept creaking every time some moved on it. The pillows were very thin and hard to sleep on. The toilet paper was like the one you get in McDonalds, single ply, the cheapest possible. Otherwise apartment was clean and easy to find. Tv and everything else worked perfectly. 
22014	75528113	42512	29752010	Lucy	My family had great stay there! We traveled from a small town, and the apt is so amazing, right in the heart  of NYC, 15min walk to time square, parking is free from near by streets. Host was really nice and respond fast with details. Our favorite part about the apt was the balcony, where my dad had much fun there than visit the empire state,lol
22014	76667619	42518	34420930	Nour	Jamil's apartment is fantastic. Exactly how it looks in the photos and the view is incredible. The building itself is clean and well located as well. Jamil is accommodating and was very quick to respond, which is always good
22014	77235576	42520	67872409	Hamdan	Really nice spot, convenient to everything, and the view is amazing!
22014	78999905	42531	49486267	Joan	Great apartment, great location, great host.
22014	80190854	42537	11220294	Stephen	We were expecting a luxury apartment that Jamil was renting out while he was out of town as indicated in the description. This is not the case. The apartment is in a great location, however the description is not quite correct. It's a permanent Airbnb rental. Jamil does not live there. Nobody does on a permanent basis. His assistant who checked us in went to great pains to inform us not to mention we are doing Airbnb to the front desk. The second bedroom is not a bedroom. It's actually a study or tv room. It has no door. The furniture is definitely not luxurious and I suspect most was sourced from thrift shops. The futon in the tv room/second bedroom is murder to sleep on.  I would not consider the fold out lounge as being suitable for any person to sleep on. When we arrived there was a leg broken off the one single lounge chair, no wine glasses and only two coffee cups. The person who checked us in was not interested in solving these issues.  She was more interested in getting her $25 checking fee.  After I contacted Jamil he was quick to replace the chair with another one (of similar quality) and he did furnish us with glasses and cups. He also refunded $100 off our room charge.  I concluded Jamil is a reasonable guy.Unfortunately his description of the apartment is misleading and I would not stay there again because of this. 
22014	84119378	42556	51109174	Narelle	The apartment was fantastic and the photos were really accurate but needed to include night photos as the view was spectacular. The place was roomy with everything you need we had two adults and two teenagers with plenty of space. It was clean and check in was really smooth. The place is well located with a market close and close to all that you need in NYC. Great experience.
22014	84646217	42559	6749420	George	Jamil was very accommodating and helpful. The apartment was excellent and well situated with a nice wine bar next door. An excellent choice 
22014	86452496	42567	61742119	Pascal	The host never showed up to welcome us. With cheap improvements, the appartement could be more comfortable: silverware, glasses, kitchenware, plates, insufficient/missing lighting, steady furniture, bed quality. The neighborhood is very fine and we were close to Time Square (15 mn walk). 
22014	87318012	42570	47365297	Ke	There is a very good view in this (URL HIDDEN) easy to go to any place I want to go. We all love this place. Thank Jamil!
22014	89502570	42579	14253214	Minh	Very nice view and great location! Jamil was very helpful with his instructions. Would definitely recommend Jamil's place!
22014	89895682	42581	41409828	Jeremy	Beautiful location and place, great communication, you wont beat the location and view for the price , dont forget to goto the roof top deck , even better then the one on the apartment.  Thanks Jamil!
22014	90813128	42584	11936740	Graeme	We found the Appt easily and exactly as promised
22014	91118753	42585	931706	Brandy	Jamil was easy to communicate with and flexible with the checkout. Apartment was as described. 
22014	93235231	42594	70512269	Sigismondo	Appartamento bello con una vista mozzafiato in un condominio elegante. L'appartamento Ã¨ dotato di tutti comfort. Jamil Ã¨ stato gentile e pronto a soddisfare le mie esigenze.Appartamento da consigliare assolutamente.Saluti Sigismondo
22014	93976307	42596	25562801	Nick	Stunning apartment right in the heart of the Hell's Kitchen area, walking distance to many restaurants and access to transportation.  The views are breathtaking and apartment comfortable sleeps 4-6 people.  Easy access into the unit with good detailed instructions and availability from Jamil.There's a parking garage immediately behind the building offering 24/7 valet parking as well.I strongly recommend renting and will most likely rent again on my next trip to NYC!
22014	96171173	42604	14277210	Lindsay	Loved our stay! The views were absolutely stunning and the apartment had everything we needed for our stay. Great location. 
22014	97238469	42608	80800344	Nicole	The apartment is in a great location, beautiful building and it is very spacious. The view is amazing and the apartment is very comfy. Check in was really easy, I would definitely stay there again!  
22014	97878946	42610	83642796	Lasia	Jami's house is totally awesome!The sight is beautiful and  clean inside This is my first time order via AirbnbJami helps me a lot !
22014	99339672	42617	69607563	Amber	Hey, probably an idea to have utensils when you have a kitchen. Apartment was really nice other than this.
22014	100616674	42623	13912452	Teresa	My colleague Nick and his daugther stayed at Jamil's while on a business trip. They really enjoyed they stayed and everything was as described. Would definitely se again! Thanks a lot
22014	102099204	42629	46486914	Susanne	We had a very nice stay in Jamils apartment. The apartment was as discribed with an amazing view. There was a sundeck on top of the building with an even more stunning view. The location was also good. We ate out every night but enjoyed taking a glas of wine before dinner and there was only two wine glasses, so there is a room for some improvement :-) otherwise everything was fine. All contact with Jamil was swift an easy. I recommend a stay in this lovely apartment.
22014	102780966	42632	6463950	Tara	The apartment was clean with an amazing view and lots of light.  Jamil was quick and thorough with communication prior to arrival.  We had a great stay.
22014	103279158	42634	90997569	Keri	The apartment was perfect for us-a family of four. We had enough space to be comfortable and the view was breathtaking. It is a couple blocks away from a bagel shop and grocery store and not too far from everything else! We are already planning our next stay!
22014	105369482	42644	7215870	Derek	Modern, clean and well located apartment with awesome views. Check in & out was easy with Jamil providing all the information needed. My second time staying there, highly recommended.
22014	106760974	42651	53785781	Sue	The whole experience was great.  All communication was quick and easy - the check in and out directions were detailed and easy to follow.The apartment was amazing - great location, great views it is near lots of little shops and restaurants that was really good.The view from the apartment was beautiful  and having the balcony just added an extra touch.The apartment was cry clean and an great size for 4 adults or a family.Having a washer and dryer was wonderful.An easy walk to restaurants and shops and Time Square.  
22014	107661895	42654	75485996	Ethan	Our stay was lovely. The bedrooms were very nice and the beds comfortable. It is located near the subway on 50th making it easy to get uptown and downtown. The area is very peaceful, no loud disturbances during the stay. The view is gorgeous as well. 
22014	109134657	42662	26419831	Anand	Amazing apartment great location great views nicely maintained in a very good building 
22014	110486721	42669	95250774	Delphine	The appartment is clean, quiet and it has a great view. We did the good choice selecting it and we could come back there for our next stay in NY. 
22014	113406633	42686	98081997	Angelo	The apartment is expensive (+30%) respect the real comfort level, the view is the best feature offered. It is clear that is not the apartment where the owner leaves, but rented for continuous business. No personal contacts at all, and no flexibility in the time for check-in and checkout, is seems a formal hotel, while it is not. The forniture are very hold, the sofa is reaped, the lower table is unstable as the bed in the second room. The carpet was very dirty , we found dirty sheets in the forniture of second bedroom. There are only 2 chairs and no table. Both beds are small, can not host 2 people each. It is placed at 15min walking from subway. Positive all the electro domestics available, the sundeck on the building roof, the gym, it is a quite building . It would be nice at more reasonable price. 
22014	120461930	42714	23722608	Nate	I have no complaints about the apartment. It was in a great location, in a great building and I had no issues checking in or out. The apartment was clean, comfortable, and exactly as shown in the pictures. I would recommend to anyone. 
22014	123276985	42732	96975449	Ulrik	Very nice apartment with a great location and fantastic view.
22014	127569023	42754	3563125	Tyler	This is seemingly an empty apartment that is rented out on Airbnb. This isnt terrible by itself. But it is worth noting.  The communication was very strict and not welcoming. We specifically didn't have trouble with the rules. But if you required flexibility, you might. I found it rather off putting.  About the place: There were stains on the carpet. One of the bedsheets had red looking stains. The living table was almost falling over. And the couch was ripped down the middle. One bed was highly unstable when you used it and was also setup in a room without a door.The place felt rather run-down.There is also a cleaning fee. Despite this, we were asked to do the dishes, clean the kitchen, and take out the trash.Finally, the balcony is not open in the winter. We were very disappointed about this as it is marketed very clearly in the description and photos.Given all the above, we would have been more satisfied in a hotel especially since we didn't get the Airbnb interaction experience with a local. 
22014	128783790	42762	60278645	Carmen Lucia	Excelente opÃ§Ã£o, instalaÃ§Ãµes e fotos correspondem ao que estÃ¡ anunciado. PrÃ©dio novo, com elevador, apartamento em andar alto, com muita luz natural e linda vista de NY.
22014	132359886	42783	108951716	ì ?ì?¤	It was perfect house in new york. The view is awesome. 
22014	135143117	42797	36021587	Marie	Appartement trÃ¨s bien placÃ©, Ã  proximitÃ© de Central Parc et de Time Square. La vue est magnifique et la situation en hauteur permet d'Ãªtre au calme dans un quartier vivant.Toutefois l'appartement a grandement besoin d'Ãªtre rafraÃ®chi, les moquettes et tapis sont tachÃ©s, les murs ont besoin d'un coup de peinture et certains meubles sont un peu bancales (chaises, table basse ...)Du fait de son amÃ©nagement (la 2eme chambre a Ã©tÃ© faite dans l'espace salle Ã  manger et donc n'a pas de porte) on ne peut pas manger sauf sur la table basse ou Ã  2 au comptoir cuisine. Enfin il manque de vaisselle : 6 verres pour 4 c'est juste.En l'Ã©tat pour 2 Ã§a va bien mais pour 4 adultes c'est juste.
22014	137298871	42808	47723302	Monica	El departamento es muy lindo,mucha luz,y una vista increÃ­ble, cÃ³modo, confortable,todo lo que necesitÃ¡s para pasar una linda estadÃ­a en esta ciudad maravillosa,y tuvo la atenciÃ³n de poder quedarnos 2 dÃ­as mÃ¡s debido a la tormenta de nieve
18872	72115137	42491	67592408	Lisa	I stayed with 7 friends and there was plenty of room! We could have fit 4 more people comfortably. The apartment is very spacious and the backyard is a perfect hang out spot. The apartment was also very clean. Wes was very nice and welcoming. The hosts also had great suggestions about where to eat in the neighborhood and where to go out at night! It is a short walk to the L train and right near a great neighborhood in Brooklyn. It was the perfect place for my group to stay since my friends were visiting from out of town.
18872	74202895	42504	4360433	Sean	Wes  looked after us and the place was great. Some of the services weren't on however as it was a new lease but he made good with offering use of kitchen upstairs. Luckily we weren't that fussy on this trip. Will return!
18872	74818864	42506	23631513	Vik	Great place, a lot of room. Comfortably can sleep 10 people, maybe more. Basic necessities were provided for bedroom items, bathroom items, kitchen appliances ,plates, cups, bowls and utensils. Outdoor patio is a huge plus! Access code for floor is very convenient. Communication was clear, made stay very easy and accessible. Only a phone call or text away if issues arised  
18872	75078826	42508	35330759	Sam	Wes was a great host! He was very helpful and understanding of travelers. This place is in a quiet neighborhood with great food options. The house was very clean and had all the necessary amenities. 
18872	76407992	42517	65797420	Quise	Nice house just no TVs clean and comfy enjoyed stay
18872	77463150	42522	74169439	Mildred	Wonderful experience 
18872	78402059	42527	26328219	Carlos	The place was just what our group wanted. The space was spacious and away from the hustle and bustle of the city. The location is close to Graham ave, which has great bars and restaurants. Overall, the place was what I wanted and more. 
18872	80770580	42540	18652279	Ashley	When we arrived, Michael welcomed us and showed us how to get in and out of the apt!  The apartment was spacious, plenty of room for me and my family & was in a great location to walk pretty much anywhere in the Williamsburg neighborhood.
18872	84585448	42559	787293	Joan	Wes has a great system for apartment access making check-in super easy and he sent a good, detailed note with apartment/neighborhood info.  But the wifi didn't work and though we reported this to Wes right away the issue wasn't resolved during our stay (and with the reason for our visit we were really dependent on internet access which we explained) - this colored our experience.    The apartment is roomy and great for a large group, kitchen is well equipped but no basics like sugar/coffee, dish & dishwasher detergent included.  Great location.  Good beds.  But not luxury.
18872	86875717	42568	4870963	Corbin	Unit was big enough for 10 of us to fit fine and was in a good location :)
18872	93958244	42596	30103071	Robert	Awesome place.  Really cool location in Williamsburg.  Close to some great food.  Wes was really awesome.  We had our other air b and b host cancel on us the week of and wes helped me out so much in such a short time frame.  We already had our flights book so he gave us an early check in and a late check out which was so amazing for our group.  The house its self was great as well.  We had 11 people and we fit just fine. Overall Wes was a really great host, the location was amazing and the house was perfect
18872	95992225	42603	64090650	Elizabeth	Great space, great location, and Wes was very easy to work with!  He made arrival and departure a breeze.  You won't find a better spot for lots of people in this neighborhood!  
18872	97948205	42611	17109709	Chrissey	traveling with a group of 7 teammates and coaches to a weightlifting meet in the area - this was exactly what we needed for the weekend.  excellent location, plenty of great restaurants/bars within easy walking distance, but still quiet with easy parking.  wes was very responsive to questions, gave detailed instructions and neighborhood recommendations.  would definitely stay here again.
18872	99629813	42618	30236652	Kate	The apartment is not luxury but in a good location. Near everything.  Wes has a great system to access the apartment. Wes responded fast but the issues were not solved. Not enough chairs to seat and eat for the number of people he says can stay at the apartment. The yard and the hot tub were not usable while we were there.  Not enough room around the beds to get into bed.  Broken closet doors!  The toilet door would not lock. Broken toilet paper holder. No mirror in the bathroom. No hooks to hang towels. Missing essentials like soap. 
18872	101490163	42626	14568441	Jack	Cool place. Great location. 
18872	104113367	42638	95471483	John	Great place. Tons of space. Great location. Enjoyed the time.
18872	108812925	42660	7274402	Christian	This apartment was clean, well suited for a airbnb, very quiet and in a great neighborhood. Parking is a little tricky but at no fault to the owner. That's just NYC for you. I would highly recommend this place to anyone staying in Greenpoint or Williamsburg area. The renter was very communicative and accommodating. ï¸?ï¸?ï¸?ï¸?ï¸?
18872	110956293	42672	6017589	Fiona	Excellent location, and hard to find x4sepearate bedrooms in one apt. Spacious w laundry in the house!!
18872	113749127	42687	102925813	Piaras	Very good host, let me book the night before, would highly recommend 
18872	114828823	42694	68528319	Junior	Wes was easy to deal with and entering the location is simple. Place was as advertised. Will recommend 
18872	116667450	42706	6153148	Steve	We were looking for a place suitable for six people for one night before returning back to the UK - this was exactly what we were looking for! Apartment was spacious, clean and Wes was helpful in accommodating a late check out the next day. Would recommend! 
18872	122776030	42729	36869334	Pat	Great location and great rooms for a large group. Our family of 11 had a holiday vacation we will never forget. 
18872	128940621	42763	25367962	Talia	My friends and I enjoyed our stay at Wes's apartment. It was very spacious and clean, and it was equipped with everything you might need. Check in and out was very easy and convenient. I would definitely stay here again! 
18872	130319915	42771	85673814	Serene	Nice open floor plan apartment convenient and serves the purpose clean and functional
18872	135588368	42799	118438242	Adam	The apartment was just as described, plenty of space, ground level, clean, and met all of our needs during a business trip. The beds are incredible, memory foam with a pillow top. Wes was a pleasure to do business with. The neighborhood is nice and safe, with delicious restaurants right around the corner. I would recommend this apartment to anyone. 
18872	136933616	42806	32996236	John	Nice place. It turned out to be bigger than I thought. There is an additional small twin bed in the breakfast nook. 
18872	138295343	42813	11764762	Rick	This is a fantastic place for a sizeable group of people (6-8) who want both a great location as well as enough beds to go around with a decent common area for everyone to gather in.  Unfortunately, we weren't able to enjoy the outdoor patio, which seems like a major selling point when the weather makes it available, but the space looked great.
19417	72767275	42494	18719639	Nikos	Alize was a perfect host. She is a very easy to talk to person ,we had a normal communication throughout our stay for some issues of the house but everything was handled perfectly. Thank you Alize for everything and if we come back to Nyc this were we gonna stay again
19417	73919816	42501	63498630	Aditya	Apartment is close to the 'Linox Terminal - 148th street' which connects you to Downtown. Super Market is nearby where you can buy stuffs. Also the apartment has easy access to the Main road which has good public transport facilities.  The apartment is well furnished with two comfortable beds and a television has good internet connectivity.
19417	74742389	42506	24410364	Tao	Alize is a wonderful host, very helpful. The two bedroom (no living room) apartment is very neat, two double beds are comfortable, the rooms are spacious. The location is very convenient, 6min walking to Subway line #3, 12 min walking to line #D. 4min walking to the supermarket. There is high speed internet. We'd like to come back to her place, my other friends also want to stay her place when they visit NY again. 
19417	75933539	42513	12309716	Roshni	Alize provided a lovely flat for us to stay in for 5 nights. The area is very nice and so convinent for access to New York. you can get to central Manhattan in 15 mins. She was a lovely host and told Us about the flat and also how to access the tube..The only issue was the space was advertised as 'entire flat' however she unexpectedly had to stay during some of the nights we were there. Not a problem as she was nice and gave us our personal space but not as private as we hoped for a romantic holiday together..
19417	77373101	42521	9056843	Michel	Nos pareciÃ³ el departamento muy comodo, el barrio tranquilo y cercano a los lugares de interÃ©s turÃ­stico.La cercanÃ­a con las dos lÃ­neas de tren subterraneo es de gran importancia al igual que la cercanÃ­a del supermercado.AlizÃ© es muy buena  anfitriona, con disposiciÃ³n para que tuvieramos una estadÃ­a excelente. Recomendable
19417	78576077	42528	44414851	Daniel	"Avoid at all costs!When I arrived at Alize's place in Harlem she informed me that she had decided to stay with us, despite the listing being for a ""full apartment"" at the time (she has since changed it).This meant that my younger brother and I had to share a bed for the week, even though we had paid for a whole apartment. After the first night Alize offered to get a blowup bed for herself so we could use both bedrooms. This bed never materialised.The flat itself is filthy. Both myself and my brother noticed that going for a shower actually made our feet dirtier as the floor in the bathroom was so unclean. I genuinely feel sorry for Alize having to live there full time, though the lack of cleanliness is likely her fault.Basic essentials such as toilet roll were not provided on the first night. A highlight of my trip to New York was using McDonalds napkins to wipe myself because of the lack of toilet roll. Alize once again promised to sort this straight away, but she didn't provide roll until 10pm the next day -- even then it was around 1 ply thick. The area in which the apartment is situation is surrounded by projects, and is quite rough. People frequently drive past the apartment at 2am with their music full blast. This is often followed a few minutes later by the sound of police sirens. My brother and I never quite felt safe when walking the short distance from 148th street station to Alize's flat (The station having bulletproof doors tells you all you need to know).Being situated close to the station was a big plus though. We could be in Times Square within around 20 minutes. An Uber or Lyft to 7th Avenue only costs around $22. In addition, Alize is very personable and easy to get on with -- though likely to tell untruths. I don't believe she's a bad person, I just believe she isn't cut out to be a host."

19417	80534619	42539	64464599	Pricilla	AlizÃ© est une hÃ´te super. PÃ©tillante, accueillante et disponible. Ouverte Ã  la discussion et pleine de bon conseils.Appartement bien placÃ© agrÃ©able et accueillant. MÃ©tro et commerces Ã  proximitÃ©.Super sÃ©jour! Je recommande vivement ce logement :)
19417	82269853	42548	56356180	Justine	AlizÃ© is a wonderful host who wont hesitate to advise you for your stay in NYC.the apartment is well located, near from subway and the neighborhood is very friendly, lively and welcoming. People are also friendly too.We fell very confortable and safe any time of the day even during night time!  i truly recommend this Airnb
19417	83431724	42553	69038898	Steven	Alize is great. Nice apartment, really nice woman. She's very helpful and friendly!
19417	84626444	42559	64208503	George	Great host and very good location!
19417	90340701	42582	66822945	Celina Del Carmen	La estadia fue fantastica, fue como estar en casa, AlizÃ© nos trato super bien y excelente persona, el departamento tiene todo para sentirte como en casa y a la redonda tambien ya que tiene todo cerca el metro o el mercado, muchas gracias AlizÃ© por todo,
19417	99512456	42618	73033061	Vinayak	I had great time at Alize Apartment while my 3 day stay in NYC. Apartment is close to Metro station which takes only 30 mins to lower Manhattan. Alize was extremely helpful and apartment has everything if you stay with family. Kitchen was well equipped...I never had expected that. My 2 year daughter enjoyed as well. I would recommend this apartment.
19417	101651131	42627	72187431	Sabrina	AlizÃ©e est une personne trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et disponible, pleine de bons conseils, le quartier est bien dÃ©sservit au niveau des lignes de mÃ©tro. PropretÃ© Ã  revoir.
19417	104528564	42640	68495330	Andrea	AlizÃ© was very nice and easy to talk to. The location of the apartment is pretty good. The police statiom is literally across the street which made me feelExtremely safe. The Subway station is only a 5 min walking distance and a straight shot to Time Square which only takes about 15 minutes. The size of the apartment is perfect for 2 people and also pretty big for a NY flat. 
19417	106828770	42651	13151466	Oreste	The owner is friendly and helpful. The apartment is very close to the 148th station that will take you to Times Square in 25 minutes. also the 145th station is very close. The apartment is also very close to several supermarkets that stay open late. People in the neighborhood are nice and friendly. In our stay we came home late and we did not find any kind of difficulties, indeed the neighborhood was very well populated at night. The only flaw in our stay were the refrigerator and cleaning in general. The fridge had some cheese in it which made the apartment quite smelly. Moreover everything in the apartment appeared sticky to the touch. But these are things that can be solved with a more thorough cleaning and is aN advice that we want to give to AlizÃ¨ that remains, however, a very nice person and a good owner.
19417	107447841	42653	87750845	Amir	Alize is such a wonderful host! Despite the confusion I gave her on arrival time, she managed to be there before we arrived. She offered us everything even the food in her kitchen! She gave us the city guide book which helped us during our trip. I could write a lot more but to make it short, overall I rate Alize 5 out of 5! 
19417	111938572	42676	54527884	Fransheska	The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
19417	120416237	42714	5855413	Gabriel	AlizÃ©Â´s place was a pleasant surprise. We knew it was outside of main tourist areas in Manhattan but the express trains two blocks away make the ride really quick. The went up and down at ease. The apartment is very well kept and AlizÃ© has been very easy to talk to and more than kind. I am really looking forward to get back to NYC and stay at her place again.
19417	120906721	42716	30716169	Gwendolyn	The place was centrally located and I found a parking spot nearby and felt safe. I was near  accessable transit and paid a reasonsable fair from Amy Ruths. It probably is a nyc thing but the stairs were a bit much since i'm pysically challenged. I rested well when I was there so if you communicate and prepare  you'll enjoy your stay. I had a wonderful weekend in NY because I was able to use her home. Thank you AlizÃ© for your warm smile and being there on time for check in/ check out.
20991	40607353	42217	13677642	Deloreon	I loved staying at Ashlea's apartment! She made me feel right at home from the moment that I stepped into the apartment. The apartment is spacious, well lit, and recently renovated. Also, the apartment is located very close to a lot of restaurants and a subway stop is only a block away. Conveniently located! Also, the apartment is very clean!Ashlea is about as great as they come! She is personable and will do anything to ensure that your stay is fantastic! I enjoyed all of our conversations and laughs! I will stay here again when I am in New York! :)  I highly recommend staying at Ashlea's apartment.
20991	91836767	42588	69881909	Salome	Ashlea was a great host! I stayed with her for around 2.5 months. She was so friendly and welcoming to make me feel at home. Whenever I needed anything or had questions about NYC she was very accommodating and timely in fulfilling any requests. Ashlea is very busy which allows for a great deal of privacy for you when you're at the apartment. Although in an old building, the apartment itself is newly renovated (as pictured) making for a very comfortable stay. The apartment is also conveniently located just around the corner from the metro!
20991	93627800	42595	39573453	Mark	Ashlea was a great host! She was very helpful assisting me getting to her apartment and was very responsive via text. She is very friendly and conversational in person. Her apartment is excellently furnished and very clean. I was very comfortable and her new smart tv in the guest room with complimentary Netflix/HBO go was an awesome extra. I enjoyed my stay very much and would suggest it to all of my friends visiting Harlem/New York. 
20991	98568786	42613	81404664	Sandra	Amazing apartment and host!! Thanks so much
20991	122244515	42726	81404664	Sandra	My cousin Natalia stayed for a full semester as she was in a exchange program and Ashlea made the experience even better. She is a great host!! The apartment is beautiful and clean in the perfect location for attending City College. My cousin always felt at home
26919	103920782	42637	4911961	Priscila	The flat is beautiful, functional and comfortable! Perfect location near all main means of transport. Excellent service and treatment. Awesome view of the Empire State. Thanks!
26919	112588230	42680	72497036	Charlotte	Had a wonderful time here. Brilliant location as it's only two blocks away from the Empire State Building and a fifteen minute walk away from other tourist sites.
26919	114859252	42694	13064425	Meaghan	We got in a little late but the doorman was there to provide help with check in..which was an awesome feature. Apartment was nice, a good size for our family of 4, GREAT location.. A little more elbow grease could go into cleaning, it was not dirty buuuut it wasn't as clean as I'd like in a 'hotel' setting... Not enough to deter me, we'd stay here again :)
26919	115997017	42701	31487222	Abigail	All I can say is great location! It is very central, close to public transportation so its easy to get around. Great for first timers to new york.

26919	130338730	42771	58403111	Alejandro	The apartment is a great place for first time New York tourists. The place was close enough to Penn Station and other lines. Walking distance to additional train lines and Times Square. Taewon was a great communicator and quickly responded to my texts and emails. Would stay here again without a doubt!
26919	133085489	42786	68575099	Marcelo	A localizaÃ§Ã£o eh excelente, Ã³timo para casal e atÃ© duas crianÃ§as, recomendo.
27701	11761065	41743	13428483	Nita	We had a good time staying at Martin's place. It was nice, clean and cozy. Martim was friendly and pleasant to talk to. Will come back next time i'm in the city.
27701	13137802	41779	12962419	Claudia	We had a very good experience on Martin's apartment. The place is great: clean, comfortable, and had everything we could need. The neighborhood is really nice, quiet, and it felt safe at all times. I'd definitely stay there again.
27701	19676139	41898	8699720	Derek	Very nice, tidy apartment. Great location.
27701	19834612	41901	18579417	Harmeet	The apartment was neat and tidy. Good view from the apartment,Â close to morning park,Â bars andÂ restaurants. Over all good place to be at.Â

27701	24745352	42006	23540265	Clancy	The apartment is exactly as described. Martin was very helpful with everything we needed to know. Getting the key and drop off was a breeze. Location not central but quiet neighborhood and easy enough to jump on subway lines to wherever one wants to go. I would recommend the place as a good base to explore awesome NYC!

20432	3588830	41324	4001057	Patrick	Ben is a great host! The room is quite clean and cozy, and the apt is great.  The wi-fi works great and you even have his Mac in your room. A few blocks from all the West Side subway lines. I've stayed a quite a few AirB&B rooms in New York and this was my favorite.
20432	5039808	41434	4377714	Vincent	Ben is a nice guy....very laid back.I stayed at Ben's place for 12 nights. I very much enjoyed it. Ben's place is perfectly situated to explore the good side of Harlem, close to City College of NY and its Covent Avenue which is one of the nicest street that I've seen in NYC. I found it easy to walk everywhere and the subway is close by. I would have no hesitation in recommending Ben's place to anyone. Ben was a good host who was willing to offer any local information or even be someone to share a joke with. And of course the cat Remy is very sweet and always ready to receive some cuddles. 
20432	5374957	41451	686104	Andrew	The reservation was canceled 7 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
20432	5512430	41458	6704872	Vanni	Ottimo soggiorno! Ho trascorso 6 giorni a NYC facendo base nella casa di Ben, dove ho trovato una stanza confortevole, con un utile Mac a disposizione, in una zona di Harlem  ben servita da mezzi pubblici, negozi di alimentari e un comodissimo grande supermercato fornito di tutto all'angolo della strada. In 15-20 minuti a piedi, almeno due posti molto interessanti per la musica dal vivo e per l'ambiente vivace e piacevole. La vita sociale nella strada non mi ha mai dato l'impressione di problemi di sicurezza. La cordialitÃ  di Ben, la sua disponibilitÃ   con suggerimenti ma anche con qualche aiuto per piccoli problemi di acquisti (fino alla cortesia di darmi la disponibilitÃ  della sua bicicletta quando non doveva usarla lui stesso!),  Ã¨ stato un fattore importante della buona riuscita del viaggio. Dunque un'esperienza pienamente positiva, che consiglio.Great stay! I spent 6 days in NYC as a base in Ben's house, where I found a comfortable room, with a useful Mac available, in an area of Harlem well served by public transportation, grocery stores and a large supermarket with everything convenient to 'street corner. in a 15-20 minute walk, at least two very interesting places for live music and the environment lively and pleasant. Social life in the street, I was never given the impression of security issues. The friendliness of Ben, his availability with suggestions but also with some help for small problems purchases (up to the courtesy to give me the availability of his bicycle when he was not supposed to use it!), was an important factor in the success of the trip . So fully positive experience, which I recommend. 
20432	18711935	41882	15218113	Renato	I stayed in Ben's place for 3 weeks and it was great. Ben is a great host and very friendly. The apartment is very nice and the room is huge! There is a lot of closet space, many drawers and even an iMac you can use if you need too. The apartment is located near the ABCD and 3 lines, and if you walk a few more streets you can go to the 1 too. There is a great supermarket near, as well as a laundry place and many places to eat. The neighborhood is safe: somedays I arrived pretty late and never had a problem.The cat is also very friendly and she never goes inside the bedrooms, most of the time she only stays in the living room waiting for cuddles.I would definitely recommend it!
20432	20563997	41913	20327041	Ma	Ben was great person,Apartment was clean and quiet   and his cat was lovely ,,totally everything was perfect ,,thank you Ben and i should say ,100% I recommend this place . 
20432	21248770	41925	16780602	Dara	This listing was exactly as described. Ben was a welcoming host. The room and the entire apartment were very pleasant. The location is quite convenient. I would stay here again. 
20432	22080523	41941	21678465	Travis	Staying at Ben's place was fantastic. Close to laundry, pharmacy, banks, lots of good and affordable places to get food from. The room is just as in the pictures. Room was clean and neat, very spacious. There is a closet to put your luggage and hang clothes in. There is also a chest of drawers to put clothes in if you prefer to have them folded and sorted. Bed is a flex and more than enough for one person and is managable for a couple as well. Bathroom is clean and cozy. Kitchen is free to use as well, has a shelf in the fridge for your food and drinks. The entire apartment looks great too, very clean and tidy. It is a quiet place, no trouble with getting around. ABCD train station is about a 5 minutes walk away and you can easily get into Times Square area in 10 to 15 minutes. Ben is a great host, always looking out for you to make sure you are comfortable and doing well. He is also very flexible and understanding, he is also really helpful and you can speak to him about anything and he will do his best to help. Remy is quite the loving tenant as well, affectionate, sweet and cuddlesome, always happy to greet you when you get home. I'd recommend this place!
20432	29835635	42107	24735523	Chad	I stayed with Ben for 6 weeks  while I was working at bronx Lebanon hospital. The apartment was exactly as described; the bedroom is very large with a large double closet and big dresser. Plenty of room for all your clothes. Ben has his own obligations as did I so our interaction wasn't extensive which was fine for myself. The bed was very comfortable and clean. The shard bathroom and kitchen  was always kept clean which I appreciate, and I always made sure to keep it that way after I used it. The neighborhood is the typical uptown area, but IHad no problems. The grocery store is open 24/7 on the block and a laundry service across the street were very convenient. The proximity to the subway made the commute to bronx or downtown very easy. Ben is a great host and was very helpful if IHad questions aboutThe city and gave me great ideas forExploring the city.  The street can get a little loud at times but there is a box fan and stand up fan that sufficiently drowns out the noise, and I prefer sleeping with a fan anyway so it was a non issue for me.I would recommend anyone toStay with Ben as I would again as well.
20432	42861101	42232	34872414	Simon	Staying with Ben was a perfect decision. The room is big and furnished with a large dresser and drawers that easily fit all your clothes. The bed is big and comfortable. Due to 3 big windows the room is very bright. There's also a small desk with an imac for you to use. Ben's cat is very friendly and well-behaved.The apartment is located in a nice Harlem neighborhood with easy access to the A, B, C, D, 1 and 3 trains. Grocery stores, laundry facilitied and restaurants are all very close.Communicating with Ben before arrival was always very easy because he responded quickly. During my stay it was a pleasure to talk to him and he was always very helpful with recommendations or directions for the area. I'd definitely stay again with him.
20432	47838978	42268	3860394	Sungduk	I was very glad to end up with Ben's place. He was a great host, and the room was exactly as shown in the pictures. This is the kind of place where I'll come back for my future trips.
20432	49104206	42278	6262481	Carolina	I felt very comfortable during my staying at Ben's apartment. I appreciated his warm welcoming as well as his indications,  previous and in place . The room is big, very cozy , bright, perfectly supplied with the needed furniture and I slept very well in the big comfy bed! All the apartment is organized , clean and quiet as there are no other guests. Location is perfect in Harlem, 5' walk distance from ABCD subway as well as 3 line,and very safe to walk around at all times(that was a concern for me, travelling alone, and Ben reassured me about it via e-mail) It's exactly as the pictures and description says.Thank you Ben for everything, I only regret we didn't had more interaction, as I spent the whole day out exploring the city!Maybe next time! ;-)I definitely recommend stay at his place. PS: Remy the cat is just adorable!
20432	49371241	42280	32344947	Tracy	Ben is very friendly and that makes me feel at home. He even provides me a small heater and an umbrella for rainy days. I really like the spacious room with a large cozy bed, and well-equipped kitchen. I also enjoy the company of Ben's cat, haha. I think the neighborhood is safe and convenient, with grocery stores, restaurants and laundry, metro within 10 minute's walk, very easy to get to downtown. I'd very much like to stay here if I'm in New York again!
20432	50792141	42291	25223821	Andrew	Can't recommend Ben's place enough, very convenient with a metro a short walk away and quick trains to time square etc. The area is diverse but def up and coming, I felt very safe at all times. Ben can recommend awesome coffee shops very close by, nothing was to much trouble for this kind and gracious host. The room and apartment very cool ,honestly a great place to stay and the delightful kitty a bonus!!
20432	50858231	42292	3003423	Marco	Ben's stay it's definitely cool and comfy - and his cat is lovely. The room is bright, not very noisy and there is essentially whatever you may need in the appartment. The area (Hamilton Heights, Harlem) it's quite safe I think, and the trains run all night stopping there close.I recommend this accomodation also for a longer stay. 
20432	52150133	42303	22865430	Allan	Ben and his friendly and curious cat, Remmy, are were wonderful and welcoming hosts. A very comfortable room and apartment located conveniently near the subway.
20432	55108760	42336	3536290	Ettore	Ben hosted me in his great apartment for a full month. I was really happy with the apartment. The location was very convenient, easy access to bus and metro. Ben was available for any of my questions and needs. I highly recommend this listing to anyone looking to stay in Manhattan. Thank you again Ben!
20432	56072706	42346	49794568	Vero	Me sentÃ­ como en casa en el apartamento de Ben. La cama es cÃ³moda y la habitaciÃ³n cÃ¡lida y confortable. El apartamento es tal y como aparece en las fotos, un lugar tranquilo y muy cerca de la boca de metro de 154th W. Sobre Ben sÃ³lo puedo decir cosas buenas, es muy amable y ofrece su ayuda siempre que la necesites. TambiÃ©n te deja toda la intimidad que quieras sin ningÃºn problema. Me encantÃ³ pasar esos dÃ­as en su casa, tambiÃ©n con su gata Remy, que es muy cariÃ±osa. Recomiendo su apartamento para pasar unos dÃ­as geniales en NY, disfrutas de la ciudad teniendo un hogar tranquilo y seguro al que volver.
20432	58615285	42372	50250285	Lukas	Ben was a great host! He was friendly and always willing to help. The room was exactly as described, you could even use a computer. ;)I was traveling alone and have to say the neighborhood is safe. I had no worries walking around. The subway is really close and perfect to explore downtown. I would recommend staying with Ben!
20432	60009363	42387	7971673	Daniel	I highly recommend Ben's apartment if you're visiting New York, especially if you're working in Manhattan. The room is pretty large, clean and has everything you need! If you need to buy groceries, there are plenty of stores very close to the apartment.His cat made my stay even better!
20432	62288233	42413	56641366	Adrian	Ben is the best possible host. The apartment is clean and I felt very comfortable there. Great choice. 
20432	64312386	42431	47103200	Lee	Room is same as in Pic 
20432	69225462	42470	58438529	Elvira	Ben is such a welcoming host - you literally feel at home as soon as you arrive and if you ever feel lonely (impossible whilst in visiting NYC!) there will be a lovely cat to cheer you up. The flat is spacious and confortable. The room looks exactly like in the picture and the area it is located is as cool as it can get. To me, it felt like living in a diverse and interesting NYC from the 70s movies. Ps. If you are girl - Ben is absolutely lovely and I felt safe during the whole time. 
20432	70400565	42477	62639610	Elektra	Ben was a very good host. The appartment is very clean and comfortable, just as in the picture. It is a 5 minute walk from the subway. If I would go back to NYC I would stay here again, because I can not think of any complaints. 
20432	77664212	42523	44913866	Christoph	The room is nice and bright. Ben is a very friendly guy. It was pleasant to stay there. I bought a bike and I took it into the apartment. Ben lent me his helmet and a big lock. That was very kind. There is a nice cat in the flat who loves to be stroked. On the weekend the street can be a bit loud because of music and laughter, but I liked it. 
20432	79903703	42535	33129434	Kev	Ben is a friendly and helpful host! Everything was as good as expected. Enjoy your stay in New York at Ben's place!
20432	81342149	42543	74129675	Joshua	Ben is a good host, easy to talk to and very welcoming.  The accommodation is the same as the pictures and is a nice spacious apartment.  With regards to its location, it is only 5 minutes away from one of the main subway stops, which is convenient.  However, be aware that it is situated in a poor neighbourhood.  This can initially be intimidating, but as long as you are smart about it there shouldn't be any issues.  I quickly got used to it, finding that most people were very friendly.  Since it is so close to subway routes though, you don't have to spend much time there if you don't want to.  There are some relatively cheap places to eat nearby such as Subway and a couple pizza places where you can get $1 slices.I would recommend it to others.
20432	85319094	42562	29944382	Unai	Ben was such a great host! The room is exactly as it seems in the pictures! The bed is comfortable and the room is spacious. Just 5 minutes walking to the metro and if you take the express, you are in Times Square in 15 minutes!! There are supermarkets and cleaners just in the corner.  Without a doubt, I would repeat the experience! 
20432	89144156	42578	78147028	Andrea	Perfect Room and Perfect Host!The room is the same of the pictures, spacious, light and very comfortable with a big bed for you! The stops of the subway is very close to the house, with 2 lines (blue and orange)  express and local, morover very close you can find also the bus stop, perfect to explore the city at any time!Every kind of shop open 24h is located in the area, very usefull when you come back after a tour of the city!Ben is amazing host, from before booking, and during of the stay.I can say that I have a new friend in the big apple! 
20432	97475004	42609	3439405	Christina	I loved staying in Bens place. Everything are as in photos and description. Nice bright room, and there are everything you will need to enjoy, your stay in NY. Close to foodplaces, supermarked, and the subway. I would love to stay there again, on my next visit to New York.Ben is a friendly person, and made me feel very welcome.
20432	100413365	42622	37130939	Mo	I stayed at Ben's accommodation for 7 nights and it was suitable for me, however note that I am 25 and not very picky. Ben is very helpful and his cat is very friendly (if your not a cat lover then maybe this isn't for you). If you are looking to stay here do take the following into consideration: (1) The room is on the 6th floor and will have to go up stairs (2) there is no washer/dryer in the apartment however there is a 24 laundry around the corner (3) There is no central or window AC but fans are provided in the room (4) The neighbourhood is safe and there is many things close by such as coffee shops, banks  7/11 and eateries (5) Its a 5 minute walk to get to the subway which is fairly handy for the A & C lines but to get to it you will have to walk ascendingly (Great exercise) (6) Some nights, people on the street blast music as they socialise, now for me the music actually helped me sleep but I can understand if some people would not like this (7) The shower is tricky, ask ben to show you how to work it as its hard to explain with words (8) Just in case you were wondering, yes the room is what you see in the picture. With that being said, I enjoyed my stay and if the above points don't bother you then you will as well.
20432	102735077	42632	46043807	Ivan	Ben is a great guy, and so is Remy, his cat. The apartment is exactly the same shown in the pictures. Even though it's in Harlem, its location is really strategic: you have Subway station for Downtown trains at 10 mins walking, groceries and supermarkets on the street. Apartment is minimal, overall clean, complete, and always kept in perfect conditions. We shared the bathroom, and it's been always clean and tidy, as for the kitchen.Bed is really comfortable, and in the room you have a closet and a drawers for your clothes.This was my first time in NY, so i spent all days out from morning till evening to discover the city, and this apartment has been a great place to stay for my whole week.Thank you Ben and Remy
20432	104853263	42641	2757069	Dustin	Everything was accurate and it was the room in the photo. The bed was so comfortable and Ben had lots of bedding if you get cold at night easily like I do. I was told the street could be loud at night but I never noticed it but I also never went to bed till around midnight, the only loud noise then is if a siren goes by but it never woke me up and it's NYC you get used to it really fast. Ben was really friendly and knew alot about the area and the city and had lots of recommendation of where to go. The neighborhood was safe and even coming back one night at 2 am I still felt safe walking the street by myself! I would stay again and for the price you can't beat it !!!
20432	107850286	42655	13866769	Katarina	Location of the apartment is great - near subway and good bus lines, do not get confused/scared by the fact that is situated in Harlem. As a girl a had no inconvenience during the whole stay. Room is spacious and light. Aparment is equiped amenities that you might need (for example adapter plug, whic is substantial for Europen travellers). Remy, the cat is not one of the boring ones and will not disturb you during the stay if you are not willing to socialize.All in all, more than great value for money.
20432	109121081	42662	95059807	Thomas	Meine erste AirBnB Erfahrung hÃ¤tte wohl kaum besser ausfallen kÃ¶nnen.Die Kontaktaufnahme, das Ein- sowie das Auschecken,  das tÃ¤gliche Leben, alles  lief reibungslos und angenehm ab. Wenn wir uns in der Wohnung begegneten, was selten war, war der Kontakt offen und herzlich. Ben ist  als Gastgeber nur zu empfehlen.  
20432	110971188	42672	20744055	Ian	Ben is very friendly and a great host. It is easy to walk from the apartment to the nearest subway station, at which both express and local trains stop. The room is tidy, spacious and comfortable. Ben is easy to talk to and provided me with some good recommendations. It's an enjoyable stay and I hope to visit again soon.
20432	113315705	42686	31096132	Katarzyna	I was at first worried about how safe I was going to feel living in Harlem - there was no need. At no point have I felt unsafe and I was coming back at different time of an evening. I found New Yorkers incredibly friendly which was a very positive surprise:).The room is very spacious. It can be a bit noisy outside in the evening or in the morning but it didn't effect my sleep (it's pretty quiet at night).Remi is a lovely cat and will not bother you if you're not a cat lover.The place is about 5-7min walk from subway. You can get express train to Times Square or Grand Central or local trains that take you to Central Park.I had a great stay at Ben's and felt very comfortable there. Ben is very friendly and helpful. Great at communicating - quick and efficient.Thank you for having me. I've had the most amazing holidays and would definitely recommend Ben's place to anyone.The flat is on the 6th floor which can be a bit of a challenge when carrying suitcases or if you've just run a marathon :).
20432	116325459	42703	17283713	Lucas	I'd say is the perfect choice. Nice and clean apartment, with such a big private room. Nice location and near a subway station. Great grocery stores nearby.And nothing but great words about Ben. A respectful and friendly host, who will help, and recommend you about the city as much as you need.All was excellent, 10 out of 10.
20432	121137345	42718	103775356	Christian	Best airbnb I ever stayed in! Everything is clean and the room is like on the pictures and the bed is great!  I had a great time in New York the Subway is just 5 minutes by walking away and you drive 20 minutes to rockefeller center etc. And there are a lot of Restaurants and upermarkets around the airbnb. Ben is a very nice host and helps you with everthing! Thank you again for the nice stay!  Everytime again this airbnb.
20432	123302267	42732	41522319	Buli	Ben is a very nice host and the place matches the descriptions perfectly. I especially like the cat, very nice and friendly. 
20432	127729645	42755	30331546	Vera	Can only recommend, great place, amazing host
20432	134691028	42794	40730471	Boris	With 145th St metro station around the corner, this place is ideally located to reach all of NYC, even though the neighborhood is not the best. But everything one needs to buy is conveniently within reach. The place is very clean, the room very bright and comfortable, and Ben was a very good host.
37279	33718864	42155	12773281	Remi	Great apartment, and excellent host! Jordan was very welcoming and accommodating upon my arrival and throughout my whole stay. The apartment is very cute, quiet, clean, and conveniently located a block away from the train, and in a nice neighborhood. Jordan was also very helpful and attentive to my requests. Thanks for everything Jordan!
37279	34688516	42165	7173713	Gual	The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
37279	67350523	42457	11394855	Holly	Jordan was a perfect host and the place fit my needs exactly. Great location right next to the train. I would highly recommend staying here
29770	4910575	41426	6246698	Hussein	Jorge's flat was great. It's spacious and quiet, but I must mention that its on the 4th floor so its a walk up the stairs. It's in a nice part of town with lots of places to eat and shop nearby. The private terrace is pretty neat as well, nice place to have some coffee or tea. The nightlife around the area is also good, and it doesn't get loud at night. Jorge's a cool guy who's easygoing. All in all, I'd stay there again if I could. 
29770	5067996	41435	6249015	Marjolein (& Hans)	Having your own little rooftop-penthouse-bedroom! We slept with the door & windows open. It's worth climbing the 4 floors.Having a drink on the roof is real nice.Jorge contacted us quick. Contact was very easy with him. Getting the key was well arranged.The apartment is nice and clean. Jorge made us our own shelf in the fridge.The bed is 160 wide and soft. I slept very well in it. ( But because my friend sometimes have a kind of a hernia and needs a firm mattress... we slept half of our stay on the livingroomfloor :-(The location is nearby SoHo and Greenwich. And around the corner you find a lot of nice cafÃ©s and restaurants (the Dutch, Market Table, Reggio's), lots of pubs in MacDougal Street, the Blue Note and comedy-club The Cellar.We had a very good stay at the apartment.Thanks Jorge!
29770	13487804	41787	201436	Daniel	Great place in a perfect location!  Apartment is comfortable and clean.  But the rooftop is the gem! Beautiful and just the space/air that is needed in NYC.
29770	16427171	41847	11210702	Karin	"Jorges apartment was perfect for us! Cool neighbourhood with lots of fancy shops, bars and deliÂ´s - far away from the loud, bustling, ""touristic"" NY but near enough to walk to most of the NY-hotspots! We slept superbly in the cosy bed, the door to the terrace even wide open, and enjoyed  by night the lights and smell of that wonderfull city! Although we havenÂ´t met Jorge before he welcomed us like ""old friends"" and was very helpful! The apt. is small but has everything (WiFi, TV, microwave, even a dishwasher we never used;) you need for a perfect stay! Thanks a lot Jorge!"
29770	23859050	41985	20112454	Nikita	The reservation was canceled 18 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
29770	24769438	42006	11881742	InÃªs & JoÃ£o	The apartment is very well located in soho. In  a very quiet street but close to the main atracttions. Jorge was always very responsive and easy to talk with, he told us a lot of nice places  to go have dinner or brunch and also listen to some jazz music, and all of them were  really nice!everything went well, the house looks just like in the pictures and we had a great time there. Nyc is amazing and we hope to come back :)
29770	30258577	42113	7123754	Chris	Jorge was a great communicator throughout the process and also a very genuine person.  The apartment more than met our needs for the extended weekend and was pretty large for city.  The weather cooperated so we were able to enjoy the outside roof area as a bonus.  The location is one of the best in NYC.  1-2 blocks from subways and any type of nightlife yet removed from the noise.  All together a great stay and great people.  Would definitely stay again.  Thank you!     
29770	31624493	42131	13489763	Kyla	The reservation was canceled 55 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
29770	33280348	42150	18665507	Alex	Awesome flat and excellent communication - thank you Jorge and Yasmine!
29770	36468273	42183	36283073	Philip	Jorge was the perfect host. Responsive and clear communication from the moment I first contacted him. The apartment was precisely as advertised and a delight to stay in while in New York. The location is fantastic with great shopping and food nearby. 
29770	37597095	42193	12470413	Sabri	Jorge fue super amable desde el comienzo. RespondiÃ³ muy rÃ¡pido mis consultas, describiÃ³ perfectamente la casa y el barrio, realmente fue un gusto quedarnos en su casa.El apartamento es muy cÃ³modo para 4 personas, con todo lo necesario para unas vacaciones. Una terraza muy linda y con todas las comodidades en la cocina, baÃ±o, living y cuarto. La zona en que estÃ¡ ubicado es ideal puesto que es segura, cÃ³moda, con todo cerca, y una de las mÃ¡s tops de NYC.Jorge fue realmente uno de los mejores anfitriones que voy teniendo y se lo voy a recomendar a todo el que pueda. Gracias Jorge por todo!
29770	45868694	42253	19358287	Dan	Wonderful host who was very responsible and flexible. Beautiful, safe neighborhood with many wonderful spots for shopping and dining. Lovely, clean apartment with a bonus deck. Would stay again!
29770	47102174	42262	42005390	Enzo	The host was great. Always a fast replay when I had questions. This was my first ABNB and it was great. Used to stay in hotels all over the world, I really felt at home at the Lana's.The place was clean and the four stairs without elevator was a good workout several time a day. I will most surely try to stay there next time I come to NYC. Everything was nice. I almost forgot the fantastic terrass on the roof, where you can have breakfast in the morning or a glass of whine later in day. The upstair bedroom was as cosy as a bedroom should be and it was a pleasure sleeping there. 
29770	48210532	42271	41549562	Elsa	We had a great stay at Jorge's apt. The place was clean and the perfect location to discover Soho and the areas around, close to many shops and restaurants.Jorge was reachable any times and very nice to us, I definitely recommend this place. Thanks again. 
29770	48593160	42274	42280469	Helen	This is an amazing apartment! Fantastic location and the apartment has everything you could need. It has a wonderful atmosphere about it, so that instantly you feel completely at home. It's very well arranged over a cute two floors, and has all the necessary towels and toiletries you could need. There are some great restaurants in the neighbourhood but it's also very easy to get around the City from here. Jorge is a helpful and friendly host. 
29770	49289637	42279	582363	Benjamin	Loved this place. It's a long way to the top but there's a great private rooftop. I thought the value was great given the neighborhood. Hosts were perfect!
29770	55928676	42345	27387114	Sue	Amazing location. Jorge was a great host and super responsive to anything that we needed.
29770	58408997	42371	30056093	Joe	The apartment is located right in the heart of Soho. Jorge was very responsive and flexible with the checkin/out times. Perfect for couples  and we would certainly stay here again next time we are in the city.   
29770	62139575	42412	35920504	Janelle	The host canceled this reservation 114 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
29770	75935749	42513	6729307	Chantal	Very nicely located apartment, small but big enough for 3 persons. Located in a very cool area with enough nice restaurants, bars and shops. The apartment has a great rooftop terrace that is nice to sit on during sunny days! Jorge and his wife were nice hosts and contact was quick and easy! 
29770	78243922	42527	72353584	Deano	Amazing host and space.  Excellent location in NYC!  Everything was lovely!
29770	84132148	42556	52952101	Marta	It was great to stay in such cool area during our trip and the proximity to all places we wanted to visit was ideal. The apartment was as described. I wish we got the opportunity to meet the host and that was a little disappointing especially that it was our first Airbnb experience. 
29770	107208901	42652	74527995	YeJin	Jorge accommodated us after our previous host had to cancel, and it was great! His apartment was gorgeous as well as very clean, comfortable, quiet, with a great view and a great area to stay in. We didn't spend a lot of time in the apartment but when we did it was everything we could have hoped for.
29770	123287138	42732	53092454	Ulf	Great apartment for me and my son. Everything we needed was found in the apartment and the terrace was absolutely great!!! Close to everything and all we needed.
29770	125038951	42738	103854493	Cj	I loved that the place was very close to the subway. The apartment also had everything up to towels, basic cookware, wifi and many more. The roofdeck was also quite nice. Will definitely stay here again the future. The area, SoHo, is already an attraction itself with a lot of good stores.
31781	121880459	42723	45470475	Michael	A fantastic experience. Great host, great spot....attention to comfort and ease.....I recommend to anyone going to queens or NYC. 
31781	123718027	42734	39516032	Jenny	Andy was a great host, place was private and clean, close to the city and stores.  Loved it!
31781	127455195	42753	12163503	Andrew	Tina was a great host. Place was great. Very close to train station. Would recommend.
31781	128284909	42758	93134891	Jonathan	We loved staying at this place. Easy access to everything and as much privacy as we needed. The only downside and this is no fault of the host or place we the people staying upstairs we loud, played music until 4am and we're walking up and down the stairs but they left after 3 nights and everything was great again 
31781	129951149	42769	39516032	Jenny	Great host will definitely recommend!
31781	130801954	42774	6718127	Jack	Cozy, clean, quiet, yet very close to train stations.  There was a neat little cafe less than 10 minute walk away, new supermarket just down the street, and 10-15 minute walk to amazing international restaurants (Indian, Thai, nepalese, Filipino).  So easy and quick to get to Manhattan.
31781	131506578	42778	21508980	Arya	Great location to the train and very close to Time Square by train. The place was very clean and cozy. I would recommend and I would personally stay at Tina's airbnb again. 
31781	132054980	42781	116112245	Carlos	Very clean safe area good landlord close to everything .
31781	132818442	42785	104543516	Alex	We had a very nice stay at Tina's! The place is easy two blocks from the 7 line which can take you across the river to 42nd Street near Times Square in just about 15 minutes. Also easy travel anywhere in Queens and Brooklyn. The room was one inside a type of townhouse, except it is very private and has everything you need with a set of your own keys. Pretty street in Astoria.
31781	134280884	42792	87965675	Jonathan	Had a great time here. Good spot for 2 people who will be spending most of the time out and about and just needing a room and bathroom. Host was excellent - very accommodating of our plans and easily in contact to help us when needed. 
31781	135598657	42799	1077346	Dennis	Tina was a great host. Communication before and during our stay was smooth. Highly recommended!
31781	137777833	42811	15843906	Diane	Very good stay, good location. Tina was very nice. The apartment is comfortable, spacious, clean and very well located. The metro is a 5 minute walk and there are several market around the apartment. I highly recommend this location.
31781	139288415	42818	72990003	Sang	Great host and communication throughout. It was an easy check in and check out.  The rooms about the size of a college dormitory. We had 3 people and that was about what that room could hold, just left enough space so we could get around the room.  No mirror or fan in the bathroom.  Neighborhood is nice and quiet, very diverse neighborhood.  There's a couple of small pharmacy shops and restaurants within a 5 min walk.  It was fairly close to the airport as well via Uber (20-40 minutes depending on traffic).It's only a 5 minute walk to public transit (subway, metro), very convenient. This is about 20-30 minute subway ride to the big city. Convenient traveling to New York and back.  If you're coming from Brooklyn, it's about 45 minutes to an hour for the subway.  Overall, this is great if you're on a budget. It was close enough to the city via subway.
10512	28328535	42085	28320342	Boaz	I really enjoyed my stay in Brooklyn. The description of the place was accurate, and it was just minutes away from the subway. Steven was very helpful, and everything went great. I truly recommend this place.
10512	28881750	42094	25466587	Valentina	La casa es muy acogedora, limpia y existen espacios comunes que permiten interactuar con el resto de los viajeros. Las habitaciones son agradables y tienen un buen espacio. En general el barrio es tranquilo, sin embargo por las noches hay que tener mas precauciÃ³n. La casa queda a 4 cuadras de la parada del metro.
10512	32503475	42143	28696189	Jana	Nice and cosy place, everything as described. Good low-cost place to stay. The room was prepared on time, we had no problems with getting in. We had to walk a few blocks to get to the nearest subway station, but the neighborhood wasn't dangerous at all, so it wasn't that bad.
10512	33910491	42157	30390072	Pete	Our stay was great. The house is always busy with people but never is it a party house. You do have your own time to do what you need to do. The space is great and exactly as described. Steven was excellent at addressing some concerns and deficiencies that we had and quickly resolved them with no fuss. The area in itself is intimidating at first but essentially harmless and wasn't an issue at any hour I do recommend some ear plugs if you're a light sleeper, the streets can be a bit loud on weekends. Overall, I would stay again in Brooklyn
10512	34203408	42161	20513532	Benikia	"Steven provided explicit directions for getting into the apt which was accurate and very helpful. This was extremely important as we arrived around midnight. I would not recommend arriving at night to the apt as there wasn't a light outside to help illuminate the walkway or the door. Going there for the first time it was unsettling trying to get into the apartment (apt) in the dark. I had to use my cellphone light to find the key and open the door. As stated by Airbnb.com, the neighborhood is"" up and coming"" but the street and area the building is located is still pretty run-down with many homes under-construction or in need of renovation. The apt and room advertised by Steven was exactly as pictured on the site. It's obvious a lot of upgrades were done to the building. The kitchen was fully stocked with every need to make the space comfortable for guests. My complaints about the apt was that the hall light didn't work, the bathroom was not clean (i.e the sink was dirty, glob of hair on the side of the tub, hair and stuck-on dirt in the tub), the dryer (of the washer/dryer set) was broken, and loud construction was done next door at 8 am. The construction time was a problem for me because I was coming from the west coast and was jet lagged. The set up of the living space was like an upgraded hostel but you don't actually see and hangout with the other occupants. Overall the space is affordable, close enough to the train and in an ok area. It's not perfect but it's good enough to sleep then head out to see the city. "
10512	45940925	42254	14580908	Carol	The place was clean and fully equipped. The bed was pretty comfortable. The only pity was the first few days the AC was not working so that we got to suffer a little bit, but Steven has been helpful and get it fixed after we responded to him. Would recommend to stay over. 
10512	46664453	42259	37375596	Aissulu	It was so good. I miss that room! 
10512	48383810	42273	33860564	Vivian	Bevor ich ein bisschen ins Detail gehe, mÃ¶chte vornherein zusammenfassend, dass ich meinen Aufenthalt vom Preis- und LeistungsverhÃ¤ltnis gut fand. Wir haben 7 Tage im Zimmer Nummer 5 verbracht und die Bewertung bezieht sich nur auf dieses Zimmer plus natÃ¼rlich die sonstigen Ã¶ffentlichen Zimmer fÃ¼r die BewohnerInnen. Das Objekt lÃ¤sst sich zwischen eine Mischung aus Souterrain und Maisonette beschreiben. Es hat zwei Ebenen . Ebene 1 hat zwei Zimmern , eine WohnkÃ¼che, ein kleines Badezimmer , ein kleiner Raum mit einer Waschmaschine und einem Trockner, normale DeckenhÃ¶hen. Ausstattung der KÃ¼che ist ausreichend. Ebene 2: ein groÃ?es Bad und ich ich meine 3 Zimmer, alle Zimmer auf der zweiten Ebene haben hohe Decken. Der DSL-Router fÃ¼r den WLAN Empfang ist auf der Ebene 2, also ist oben der beste Empfang. Das Objekt ist modern und neu eingerichtet und es tÃ¤glich wird sauber gemacht, also die Ã¶ffentlich Zimmer, nicht das bewohnte Zimmer. Das Personal, also in dem Fall der Putzmann war sehr freundlich. Die Gegend schien mir ein bisschen gefÃ¤hrlich , wobei ich fairerweise sagen muss, dass wir keinerlei schlechte Situationen hatten. Dennoch empfehle ich vor 22 Uhr wieder zu Hause zu sein. Am Tag wirkt die Gegend freundlich. In der NÃ¤he findet man Imbisse und EinkaufslÃ¤den. Die Lage zu der Bahn ist gut, zu FuÃ? braucht man max. 10 min. Nach Newyork Ca. 30 min. So und nun mal kurz die Pros und Cons.Pros: Lage zur Bahn , Objekt modern, Preis, Vermieter und Personal waren nettCons: Zimmer Nr.5 war sehr kalt, LÃ¼ftung ist nicht ausschaltbar und laut, unterm Bett war es nicht sauber, Antwortzeit vom Vermieter Ca. 1 Tag, GegendWenn mich fragt, ob ich noch mal dort Ã¼bernachten wÃ¼rde, wÃ¼sste ich es nicht. Es kommt drauf an. 
10512	49783372	42283	20423538	Anja	Alles war wie auf den Bildern und in der Beschreibung. Steven war immer per Mail erreichbar und hat uns alle Fragen schnell beantwortet und uns weiter geholfen. Die Haus war wirklich neu gemacht und schÃ¶n und eingerichtet, es war alles da was man brauchte! Was etwas gewÃ¶hnungsbedÃ¼rftig ist ist die LÃ¼ftung unter dem Bett, die ist recht laut, nach ein paar NÃ¤chten gewÃ¶hnt man sich jedoch daran.
10512	51019243	42294	20265806	Saifon	This house is very near bus station but it is very far away for the downtown. It takes around 1 hour and 30 minutes to go to downtown or highlight place. If you stay a short period for traveling, I will not suggest you to stay in this place. Moreover, the bed in my room was very terrible because it was broken but I told the host to fix it. As a result, the host bought the new one to solve this problem. Overall, this house is very clean and comfortable to stay but it is far away from downtown and highlight place. 
10512	51709658	42301	41381873	Lauren	The place was clean and conveniently close to subway stations. The other guests mostly kept to themselves but some had time for small talk. Would stay here again on my next trip back.  
10512	52584415	42308	22484221	Camille	L'appartement se situe Ã  10 min Ã  pied du mÃ©tro, ce qui est plutÃ´t pratique ! Notre chambre Ã©tait trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et calme, mais il ne faisait vraiment pas trÃ¨s chaud dans l'appart en gÃ©nÃ©ral .. Pour ce qui est de la propretÃ© c'est aussi un peu limite .. Les parties communes ne sont pas vraiment propres (cheveux/poils , urines,...)Sinon pour le prix c'est plutÃ´t correct Merci Ã  Steven pour ses rÃ©ponses trÃ¨s rapides via mail 
10512	53346224	42316	36440190	Lucy	Unfortunately on arrival we received the wrong keys and tried for an hour to get in to the apartment! As you can imagine after a very long flight we were very impatient to get in and Steven took a while to aanswer our messages and calls but did come to meet us about 45 mins later and resolved the situation. We then didn't have hot water for two nights of our stay due to a technical problem and Steven seemed to do what he could to help and we were refunded part of what we paid for both nights, which we were happy with. Even though we had a poor start we had a wonderful time in this New York apartment. The other people staying there were very friendly and the apartment itself was brand new and very clean/safe. It was also a great location, only 10 mins walk from the local subway. I was impressed with the apartment itself and thought it was a very good price for what it is. 
10512	54861426	42333	14101276	Samantha	My experience at the apartment was great. The space is really nice and the common areas always clean - just like in the photos. the people at the house during my staying were very friendly (lucky me!), good showers and comfy bed! The only thing I missed actually was a headboard in my bed! 10 minute walk to the 3 and C subway lines. I didn't have the chance to meet Steven but he sent me instructions for checking in and out and it was allright! Besides, he was always available through the app and responded quickly everytime I needed him. Strongly recommend :)
10512	55525155	42339	8934151	Nelia	The house was OK, although it worked more like a hostel than a particular house. This is the first time that I've seen that, using airbnb, but I've been told that's usual in NYC airbnb's. It was well communicated, the subway is just ten minutes walking from the house. The room was clean, although the bathroom could improve. And I suppose that it depends on the room you are, but the heating was quite loud in ours, so if you wake up easily, I wouldn't recommend it. A positive thing is that Steve was quick responding my messages.
10512	61898324	42409	52754771	German	 La descripciÃ³n, ubicaciÃ³n, limpieza y facilidades del apartamento corresponden a las referenciadas en la pagina WEB, el lugar es seguro, acogedor y cercano a las estaciones del Metro de NY.Se recomienda para tomar una temporada corta o larga.German Vega, Bogota, Colombia
10512	62218089	42412	18692282	Liliane	The apartment is very cozy, clean and well located. Unfortunately there were some setbacks as to the dates and the booking but it was all resolved by Steve. Thank you for your kindness.
10512	64271335	42430	60371277	Josephine	Listing description was accurate. Pictures are of the actual listing too. Amazing facilities. Neighborhood was very quiet which scared me walking from the subway at night. But once I got to the apartment I felt safe.
10512	64906933	42438	51702430	Ruben	Great place, perfect location. Was the perfect choice. 
10512	65545349	42444	52961740	Elyse	Petit problÃ¨me Ã  l'arrivÃ©e car nous devions laissÃ© les bagages et nous n'avons pas pÃ» mais Steven nous a laissÃ© faire un Check-Out tardif.Nous n'avons rencontrÃ© d'autres locataires dont des FranÃ§ais c'Ã©tait sympa.La chambre Ã©tait agrÃ©able mis Ã  part la climatisation qui faisait un bruit MONSTRE. MÃ©nage pas bien fait pour 23â?¬, ce serait le point Ã  voir car il restait des Ã©tiquettes de vÃªtements des prÃ©cÃ©dents hÃ´tes.A part Ã§a quartier tranquille, il y a un lycÃ©e en face surveillÃ©, on se sent en sÃ©curitÃ©.L'appartement est Ã  10min Ã  pieds de l'arrÃªt du MÃ©tro et Ã  20min en mÃ©tro de Manhattan.
10512	66211057	42449	59651832	Jody-Ann	The apartment looked exactly like the picture. It was really cozy and quiet. The AC vent in room five makes this loud banging sound when it cuts on, pretty scarey at night but you get used to it. I would stay there again. The Subway is about 4 blocks away, sounds far but you get used to it. 
10512	68765543	42466	30620184	Nicole	All the instructions to enter the apartment were detailed and late check in wasn't a problem at all. The apartment was clean and really pretty. Still, the neighbourhood was not what I expected and we would never come back home late at night by train. We always ubered and went straight into the apartment. However, we never met Steven and we never had to contact him about anything, the apartment came with perfect instructions as I mentioned above. Thanks for having us, Steven!
10512	69214118	42470	56249511	Nancy	Great accommodations! Super clean. Loved the location. In and out well-organized. Nice to have the washer-dryer and the use of the full kitchen. Worth the price.
10512	70669141	42479	59067674	Kia	Steven was a great host. the apartment is in an excellent location well connected by subway . living in Brooklyn for 8 days was wonderful . it is the Best way to enjoy our journey in a city like New York. Really recommended. TOP 
10512	73173581	42497	55444596	Yolima	La casa correspondÃ­a a las fotos publicadas. La estaciÃ³n de metro mÃ¡s cercana quedaba a 10 - 15 minutos caminando rÃ¡pido, por lo cual no nos sentÃ­amos muy seguros llegando tan tarde al sector. En general estuvo bien y siempre nos comunicamos por mensaje con Steven. DespuÃ©s tuvimos unos vecinos no muy agradables( ruidosos// baÃ±o mojado).
10512	74541871	42505	43968953	Cesar	Room and apartment is as you can see in the pictures.Just in front of the apartment there is a Bus #65 stop that takes you in around 20 minutes to the center of Brooklyn were many subway lines to Manhattan can be taken.In a walking distance of 10 minutes from the apartment, you can also reach 2 different subway stations that take you to the center of Manhattan.There are several convenience shops in the surroundings. We considered it as a safe neighbourhood and we did not detect nothing dangerous.Room was clean enough. We would repeat.
10512	77528268	42522	5572551	Anna	Everything was ok, except fact, that we have I think the worst room,  right under our window were 2 big funs, which were very loud. The first 3 nights were terrible. We were very tired after exploring the New York, and in this horrible din we could not rest, sleep. It was really big problem, and I wrote about that to Steven, and the next nights were quite acceptable. We could to sleep. Overall was ok, the apartment is comfortable, look like on the picture. The neighborhood is safe, 10 min walk to subway. Thank you Steven, I hope that the next time you give us a better room , away from fans :-)    Regards  Anna
10512	81690927	42545	29489074	Elisa	Good location, well equipped apartment but since there are 5 rooms in total the quality of your stay will depend on the other guests as well. We were a bit unlucky to have noisy neighbours and in our room you heard everything.
10512	84618702	42559	37415291	Wouter	We really enjoyed our stay at Steven's place. He was very flexible with the timings. The appartment was clean and cosy. Although he doesn't live there himself (I think), all the necessary supplies were there. Subway is about a 7 min walk, bus is right in front of the door. We recommend it to all of you.
10512	98601526	42613	179861	Danilo	La casa Ã¨ carina e ben tenuta, anche se una sola cucina per almeno 10 persone rende la casa affollata.Il quartiere non Ã¨ un granchÃ© ma Ã¨ vicino a una fermata metro collegata anche di notte ed Ã¨ tranquillo.Il problema maggiore durante il nostro soggiorno Ã¨ stato per l'aria condizionata che partiva automaticamente e facendo molto rumore. Per questo non consigliamo di alloggiare nella stanza 5.Stanza e bagno puliti.
10512	111906420	42676	40446269	Katherine	It was very nice to stay at steven's place, I got to meet so many fantastic people and the house is very clean, the metro station it's on a walkable distance and there's convenience stores close to the house. Thank you steven for having us at your place.
10512	113399430	42686	85415545	Helena	We had a great time at Stevens place. It looked just like on photos. He was here for all the question and gave us accurate informations. Room was nice and quiet, had a good sleep :)
10512	114321005	42691	83851488	Marisol	This place has everything you need.
10512	115185371	42696	102533344	Thierno	It was very nice to stay in this  home everything was perfect very clean place as you see all the pictures we really loves everything about this home home I will be back to this place for more time again thanks Steven for your beautiful place.
10512	116444013	42704	61019597	David	Really enjoyed our stay there. Nice and clean place. Definitely recommend it!
10512	117329198	42710	24094146	Tegan	Steven was very easy to communicate with and replied quickly to messages. Check in and out was also easy and we were also able to leave our bags for a later pick up. You can walk to the subway in 10 mins. Tip for room 5, if the heating/aircon is on, turn the fan part to auto rather than on as otherwise the room is too loud to sleep! 
10512	121704981	42722	101748926	Chase	The apartment was pretty nice, and having food delivered was simple and timely. Steven was very easy to work with. It's just a short walk to the C train, which can be crowded in the mornings, but is a straight shot to Manhattan!
10512	125387187	42740	82972045	Gabriele	We really enjoyed our stay at Stevens house in Brooklyn, the house was comfortable and warm. Even if we have never met Steven he has promptly responded to our requests and emails. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen plenty of pans and accessories. The only problem was the fan of the heating turning on and off in the middle of the night(as we were in room n.5). I would come back to and book again for this apartment. Thanks SteVen 
10512	127362200	42752	108043328	Damir	Had a great stay, I recommend! Young people stay here!
10512	128425842	42759	74846589	Jose Alberto	We had a great time there, it is near to the subway station and all the appartment was really pretty and always clean. Totally recommended 
10512	131516774	42778	109735986	Lourdes	Great, comfortable place close to public transportation. 
10512	135335651	42798	53194177	Darnell	Amazing stay
10512	136558356	42805	110666557	Maria	Amazing modern place. Steven is pretty quick when it comes to responding when you need help. Wish it was a little bit closer to the subway. Not that close. In the warmer months I wouldn't complain. Delis everywhere! Ok neighborhood.
10512	137962341	42812	49733032	Antoine	A noisy climatisation (we had difficulty to adjust the thermostat) but the room is spacious and the bed is comfortable (and was clean to our arrival). 
10512	140726016	42825	13163958	Pedro	Nice place, exactly as in the description, comments and the how it looks in the pictures. 10min from the subway line c, which allows you to easily get into the main places in Manhattan. Quiet neighborhood, and I've never found any problems even when walking back from the subway during the night. I also recommend the food from some of the Delis next to the subway station.I Had the chance to meet Steven, who's a very nice host and always ready to help. I would stay in this place again. 
30097	85105659	42561	73134402	Emilio	The home was nice and comfy in a quiet neighborhood as listed on the Airbnb website. We all slept comfortably, enjoyed our stay, and ended up leaving a day early due to change of plans. Would book here again if I ever found myself in the Bronx again! thanks Brian appreciate you man.
30097	87830681	42573	62348373	Emma	Spent 9 days at Brian's studio in the Bronx. Brian is super helpful, helped with a late check in and whatever else we needed. He was easy to contact during our stay. The space is clean and well kept. Definitely recommendable. Parking very close. (Do note that there are no utilities for cooking there, so you'd have to bring those if you'd want to use the kitchen) Brian helped us have a wonderful experience. Thank you! 
30097	88435920	42575	48160329	Favio	Great experience. The apartment was spacious and had everything as listed. The only con i had is that it was a bit warm, but there was multiple fans to help. Enjoyed my stay and would definitely use Brian's place again
30097	90578833	42583	80399580	Marko	Awesome apt and awesome authentic Bronx experience . Recommended 
30097	91617569	42588	84941545	Trenton	Brian's place was awesome and he was a great host. He was really helpful and made sure we had all the things we needed. His place is in a nice neighborhood and it's really close to the subway. Everything you would need as a traveler is in walking distance. I would recommend Brian's place to anyone!
30097	92661637	42591	76665111	Kerslie	Brian was a very great host! He worked with me when I had to change my check in hours the night before and he had a very tidy and simple set up! My boyfriend and I just wanted to spend some time together in a quiet area where no one could bother us and that is exactly what we got. Brian was easy to contact if I had any questions regarding the apartment and he pretty much let my boyfriend and I be unless we needed him. Wonderful first time experience with Airbnb and Brian is someone I would indeed come back to! Thanks again Brian! :)
30097	93485997	42595	32954147	Ernest	It was a great stay!
30097	94767068	42598	15347044	Amanda	Brian and his family were very nice. 
30097	100334694	42621	2905555	Shilpa	Brian was very easy to communicate with while making the booking. He was also accommodating on the day of arrival even though it was a late night check-in and was flexible with the check-out  and with our request. The place was nice and clean and overall it was a good experience! I would definitely recommend staying here.
30097	101884985	42628	86710038	Ravshan	Absolutely perfect place.definitely stay here again.
30097	104124000	42638	41577716	Terri	Brian was a great host.  The apt was just as described in the photos.  Brian was available if we had questions.  Check in and check out were easy.
30097	105139873	42643	92903360	Oscar	Mi esposa y yo nos sentimos como en casa ,el departamento estaba muy limpio y fue muy cÃ³modo ,estaba igual como lo que se ve en la foto ,los anfitriones fueron muy amables y dispuestos a ayudarnos en todo ,la casa estÃ¡ ubicada a 25 minutos de Manhattan en auto pero fÃ¡cil de (URL HIDDEN) calle es muy tranquila,callado y segura, dormiamos cÃ³modamente.
30097	108353143	42658	6976550	Sofia	Everything about this listing was great. 
30097	110247765	42668	82712552	Robin	Het contact met Brian was heel goed! Hij reageerde steeds snel en accuraat en probeerde te helpen waar mogelijk. Het appartement ligt in een mooie, rustige straat in de Bronx op slechts 10 minuten lopen van 2 metrostations (lijn 6). Deze lijn heeft deels ook expressdiensten zodat je vrij vlot in Manhattan kunt zijn. (variÃ«rend van een half uur tot een uur).Het appartement heeft alles wat je nodig hebt om te verblijven: keukentje, badkamer met hele fijne douche! en slaapgelegenheid. Als het mooi weer is kun je zelfs in de tuin zitten! Kortom: een absolute aanrader met een perfecte prijs/kwaliteit verhouding!!! 
30097	112266671	42679	80298398	Adrien	Very good trip. A very quiet place. Close to the subway. Brian is a good hoste. Thank you for all brian :) !!
30097	113111248	42684	21289896	P-Yves	IdÃ©al pour visiter NY Ã  un tarif raisonnable. MÃ©tro proche. Quartier sÃ©curitaire et agrÃ©able. DÃ©panneur proche pour petit-dÃ©jeuner chaud. Appartement confortable,  serviettes de bain et produits de douche Ã  disposition. Je le recommande. 
30097	115297928	42697	45761858	Christina	Brian consistently responded promptly via the app to questions and was flexible with check-in & checkout. The neighborhood was quiet & some sounds could be heard by Brian's small family upstairs, mostly if you're a light sleeper. Pictures were accurate & we were able to do some cooking. ~10 min brisk walk to the 6 train, little less than an hour to get downtown (less if you can switch to an express train). Brian was also helpful in cleaning a little extra for my mild allergy to cats. Overall, a very appreciated stay when a previous Airbnb booking unexpectedly cancelled.
30097	115986207	42701	28843595	Antonio	Nice cozy studio apartment. A convenient 10-15 min walk to the train station, or if you are taking lyft to get around you don't have to wait more than 2-3 minutes for a car. Brian was really accommodating and he made sure our needs were met. A good place to relax if you have been exploring the city for the day. 
30097	117020450	42708	75448714	Shaneil	Brian & his family were amazing!! Very accommodating & understanding of our flight arrival/departures. Brian was quick to responding to any of our concerns & even gave us advice on how to get to and from the places we wanted to go. If I'm ever back in town, I'll definitely be booking with them again. Great family & beautiful home. Main floor apartment was exactly as described. 
30097	121377637	42720	88577407	Thanos	Nice studio apartment with private entrance in The Bronx. Nice hosts, good communication, offered to assist with all our needs. We enjoyed a restful stay!
30097	122026006	42724	68872706	Shade	The apartment was perfect. Brian and his lovely family were great hosts. They were communicative and went above and beyond to make sure my wife and I had everything we needed in order to have a private and comfortable place to lay our heads whilst on holiday. The subway is a few steps away and you're in Manhttan before you know it. Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a private and affordable spot to crash while visiting New York for holiday. 
30097	123277006	42732	96314144	Dylan	Studio conforme aux photos, quartier calme (mÃªme en rentrant tard), proche (environ 10 minutes) de la ligne 6 qui mÃ¨ne Ã  Manhattan et prÃ¨s de structures pour manger ou s'approvisionner. Brian reste Ã  dispositions si vous avez besoin de quoi que ce soit, studio parfait rapport qualitÃ© / prix pour dÃ©couvrir New-York pour la premiÃ¨re fois !
30097	124734403	42737	102528302	Jonathan	Brian and Karim are very kind and accommodating hosts. They are both very approachable and easy to talk to or reach via text if you have any questions. This is a nice private and peaceful little place comfortable for couples. There are laundry machines in the apartment but are not for guest use. If the hosts have laundry in the machines they will get it when you are not there. They are very respectable when it comes to giving space and providing privacy.  The apartment is a 5min walk to the bus that will take you to the 2 line or a 13min walk to Middletown station which puts you on the 6 subway line. I would definitely recommend staying here. You are only an hour out from Manhattan. Enjoy your stay!
30097	126007561	42743	24620686	Manny	Great place, walking distance to restaurants and bars. Brian was a great host, love the place very cozy and has everything you need. Thank Brian. 
30097	126652453	42748	110331757	Joe	Great place and good people!
30097	127209847	42751	107316140	Angel	Brian and his family were great. Great little studio apartment. Offered towels and linens. We had to leave an it early, my wife was feeling ill, but they were very accommodating and nice. Thank you. I would definitely book again
30097	128291253	42758	37598191	Odain	Brain was an accommodating and flexible host, would recommend for anyone who doesn't mind a bit of a ride to Manhattan, on the subway. Neighborhood appeared safe.
30097	129167322	42764	26154456	Angela	Everything listed about this studio is what you exactly get when you arrive. The photos are accurate. Brian was accommodating with my check-in time and very responsive to my e-mails during my one night stay. The place is about 30-35 minutes drive away from Manhattan, so not bad at all. The neighborhood was quiet and seems safe. Overall, I enjoyed my stay!

30097	134512658	42793	1441749	Catherine	The neighborhood is quiet & safe.  If you like to walk, there's a grocery store a few blocks away & numerous restaurants as well as diners up & down Tremont.  Uber is available too & the bus system runs on Tremont.  I didn't use the subway on this trip, but as you can tell from other guests it's close too.  Brian was very helpful and the apartment is private and clean.  I would definitely recommend this location to others and if I can make it back in a few months, I will stay here again.  Thank you Brian.

Hope was very helpful and had many great place to recommend.
38078	32896715	42147	21550926	Miriam	Hope is a lovely host with a beautiful Williamsburg-apartment. The area is perfect for going out, having breakfast or dinner and shopping. The connection to Manhattan is perfect and very easy. The apartment is very clean and has everything you might need. Hope makes you feel at home in her place. We had such a great time staying with her.

38078	37240213	42190	10491466	Lovis	Hope was a wonderful Host and I look forward to another stay at this beautiful apartment.  It's very orderly and clean, has everything one could ask for after a long journey like mine, most importantly the bed is very comfortable.  I loved the neighborhood and that the trains are literally around the corner. Thank you for a wonderful stay.
38078	38597817	42202	16809749	Mette	I have had a great time staying at Hopeâ??s lovely place in Williamsburg. The apartment is very cozy and spacious - itâ??s very comfortable, clean and has everything you might need for a great stay. The place is well located in a nice area close to the subway station. Hope is a wonderful host - very welcoming, easygoing and helpful. It has been a great pleasure to stay with her, and I will definitely stay there again for the next time I visit New York.
38078	39748626	42211	2794254	Alicia	Hope was a wonderful host - very kind, helpful and welcoming. I felt very at home in her place, and it was a nice retreat from the bustle of other parts of Williamsburg. The place is as light as it appears in the pictures, not too noisy (at times there was music coming from the street below - which is a nice kind of noise!). Kitchen well equipped, bathroom clean and always available. I'd definitely stay there again!
38078	41604574	42224	23080048	Konrad	We had a wonderful week in Hope's lovely furnished and comfy apartment and enjoyed it a lot.  The place is near two subway stations and about 10 minutes walk from Bedford ave. Hope is very friendly and helpful. Thanks a lot!
38078	42896312	42232	38035171	Areli	Hope was the best, best, best host! My boyfriend and I were completely comfortable in her adorable space. Everything is clean, cute and thoughtfully organized. It's a great location full of life, bars and little shops. We were fortunate enough to meet some of Hope's friends and got a better feel for everyday NYC life. They were all just as cool and easygoing as she. I will definitely be back and plan to reconnect with Hope. Thank for everything, lady! 
38078	47031875	42262	14290553	Alice	We had a wonderful time staying at Hope's. The apartment is a really great place to relax; spacious, stylish, well equipped, clean and quiet. The room is really nice with lots of storage space, and a view of lower Manhattan! Hope is a really laid-back, friendly and helpful host, she gave us loads of great advice on good spots in the neighbourhood. The area has a lot of great stuff going on, both in terms of cool restaurants and bars and practical stuff like supermarkets, laundromats etc. and is really well connected, with the J, M, Z, L and G trains all a short walk away, and with Bedford Ave only a 5 - 10 minute walk away. All in all this is the perfect place to base yourself to explore Brooklyn, we would definitely stay here again!
38078	48018906	42269	9184276	Alma	The apartment was very clean and looked like the pictures. Hope was a great hostess. Good information before and during the stay. Extra thanks for the donuts we got from Hope when we left :D
38078	49313986	42280	23652268	Julie	Our 10 days stay at Hope's place has been absolutely amazing !! Hope is such a nice host, very helpful, deeply kind, and we had great conversation. The flat is beautiful and cosy, we felt just like at home! and of course there is everything you need as you can use Hope's kitchen. Don't know what else to say except a huge thank you to Hope for that place !Also, the location in Williamsburg is very convenient, lots of subway lines, and very close by.
38078	52046530	42303	20167669	EloÃ¯se	Hope is a very nice host! We had a lovely stay in New York.Her apartment is ideally located, only one subway station away from Manhattan, at the heart of Williamsburg.Hope lets her hosts enjoy as much as they want the living room. We had a lot of privacy, which is not always the case when you rent a shared apartment.  Hosts can also use all the needed kitchen tools and spices.In short: You'll feel just like a true New Yorker is a lovely and nicely decorated apartment! 
38078	53113695	42313	5518012	Diederik	Hope provided us with detailed information about the neighborhood and place, so we knew what to expect. Even though we arrived terribly late, we felt very welcome. The place is wonderfully decorated and there is more than enough privacy, so it really felt like a home away from home.
38078	58786051	42374	44242245	Matteo	We had a really comfortable stay at the apartment of Hope!The announcement of fee was faithful and the house of Hope was as we expected. Clean and tidy. And Hope was a host very friendly and helpful! We enjoyed it a lot even in the Quarter! We recommend a nice breakfast to O'thans!
38078	60879580	42398	6188445	Marco	Hope's place is perfect. Close to everything you need when visiting NYC, clean and spacious. Not to mention being in a vibrant neighbourhood and walking distance to all the best parts of Brooklyn. Hope was also awesome so lovely and very helpful and approachable with any questions I had and communicating prior to and during my stay. Her guide book is great!! As someone who has visited NYC a few times this is by far the best accommodation I have had. Perfect for a couple or single traveler who wants to chill and feel like a local or the tourist who wants to see all the Manhattan sites but with an off the beaten track NYC/Brooklyn experience. 
38078	61997420	42410	2923936	Russell	Nice apartment in cool Williamsburg.
38078	63639315	42425	50710916	Gyu RI	Hope was one of the sweetest person I've ever met in the city. The house was really cute and artsy, so I was able to sense her taste in decorating her own place. She always replied instantly for any kinds of questions via text, it was really easy to communicate. Her recommendation list was really great, hidden and non-touristic places, one of the cafe is still on my top list I've ever visited in the city. What I really loved was the table in the kitchen, I was able to enjoy her tea selection and coffee by myself. Sometimes, we spent time in the kitchen talking, which was really kind of her. She took me out oneday to a nearby bar where only locals know. In my personal opinion, the Lorimer st, the L train is the easiest to go anywhere in the city. Everything was perfect, even the most tricky part in every house, the restroom has so much sunlight in with the window, it has always been clean and fresh. 
38078	64075716	42429	47990852	Connie	Great experience staying at Hope's apartment. She was very prompt with communication and giving us directions from the airport. The apartment was spacious and clean and room was so comfy! The bathroom is a bit on the small side but wasn't a problem for us. Hope provided very detailed house rules and list of suggestions in the area. Centrally located close to the bridge and multiple subway stops, and short walk to central Williamsburg. Would definitely stay again. 
38078	64434068	42433	527577	Olga	Hope was the best host! I had a great time staying in her apartment. The neighborhood is great, only one stop away from Manhattan, with great tacos and coffee just around the corner. The apartment was very clean and full of light, I felt very welcome to use all the facilities such as the kitchen and living room. Hope was also very helpful in giving me tips, like the best car service or brunch spot. : )
38078	66970568	42455	28857660	Synne	Hope's apartment in Williamsburg is just as beautiful as the photos suggest. We thoroughly enjoyed having our breakfast at the large wooden table in the sunlit and spacious kitchen, and it was great to relax for a while in the living room after long days out and about in the city. The bedroom has a large mattress, a wardrobe and even a desk with a very comfortable chair, so it should be convenient even for those who need to get some work done during their travels. The area is well connected to Manhattan by several subway lines, and within walking distance to many nice areas on the Brooklyn side of East river. Communication with Hope went smoothly. She is responsive, respectful, friendly and eager to share her expert knowledge of the area. It was a pleasure to be her guests! 
38078	68073492	42462	52284689	Jessica	Hopes place was fantastic! Location is great - a very short walk to the subway, and a number of good restaurants and coffee shops. Her recommendations for places to eat are great - you have to try 'Diner' if you stay here, it has been the best meal we had in America. The room is neat and has everything you could need - Hope also provided travel sized shampoo, conditioner and body wash which was great for our stay. We felt very welcome to use the kitchen for tea and coffee, and to use the living area if we desired. The apartment itself is very well insulated so if you are acclimatised to a tropical climate (as we were) and it gets below negatives (which it did whilst we were there) you will be warm enough and do not need to worry about wearing multiple layers inside. Hope was a great host and very accomodating and helpful, and allowed us as much privacy as we wanted. Overall, this was a fantastic place to stay and I would highly recommend it to others! 
38078	76171735	42515	17375984	Katie	Hope was really welcoming and relaxed and gave me lots of brilliant local tips. Her flat is lovely - spacious, chilled, bright, light and in a really interesting part of Williamsburg. Perfect location for exploring the rest of Brooklyn and easy walk into Manhattan (lower east side), over the Williamsburg bridge.I was staying for three weeks and it felt like a home from home. Muchos gracias Hope!
38078	78225435	42526	20408701	Liz	Hope was super accommodating and friendly. Although you share the apartment with her, it felt quite private-- living room is yours to lounge in. Cute place. We didn't cook, but easily could have. Location was perfect and we could get to Manhattan in under 20 minutes. Only downside was that it's a walk up which is a bit tough with bags after a day of travel, but otherwise lovely.
38078	80051188	42536	1868789	Mark	Hope was an excellent host. She made us feel very welcome and provided so much helpful information about the area in her information pack. The room was very clean and tidy and had lots of room for our huge suitcases! The lounge, kitchen and bathroom were all well presented. The location is great with lots of public transport options to get downtown and it is easy walking distance to local Brooklyn attractions. We would definitely stay again!
38078	81149091	42542	5319159	Alena	We had a wonderful stay in Hope's beautiful apartment! Everything worked out perfectly, we met her and she showed us around and explained everything to us. We felt so very welcome from the beginning on and we loved to come back to her apartment after a long day in the city. We were able to use the kitchen, and everything was so clean! The bed is very comfortable and her whole apartment is decorated and furnished beautifully.  Hope is very kind, lovably and flexible. We really really enjoyed our time in Williamsburg and I would highly recommend staying at Hopes place!
38078	82470640	42548	45169594	Devin	This was our first ever airbnb experience, and of all places in NYC!  We really enjoyed our stay with Hope, at her lovely little apartment.  The location was perfect for us and was very close to a metro stop.  Hope's food recommendations were spot on.  We didn't see to much of Hope but she seemed lovely when we did see her.  Great stay, thanks Hope. 
38078	83614331	42554	13814369	Karina	The reviews are true, Hope is an excellent hostess and her home is clean, warm and welcoming. Well located, adjacent to many Brooklyn hotspots and a quick trip to L.E.S. Plenty of space and privacy in the apartment, but nice knowing Hope is available if you should have questions or need assistance. My partner and I felt like we had our own place in Brooklyn and that was a nice feeling in a big city. 
38078	85499030	42562	6270921	Ross	Wonderful experience in Brooklyn. A lovely space and a lovely host, we couldn't have asked for a better place to stay to see NYC.
38078	87661806	42572	13514009	Ruya	"The Sunny Private Room in Williamsburg had definitely exceeded my expectations!The location was perfect; a few mins walking distance to two subway stations, amazing cafes and restaurants. It was also very close to some of the most unique shops in the neighbourhood too! The flat was decorated very nicely, with close attention to detail and the room was spacious with a very comfy bed (and cotton linen) which was just perfect after walking around all day long, exploring the city. Also, Hope has been very communicative from the beginning and helped me with some great and ""local"" suggestions! I couldn't have asked for more from such a lovely host who had clearly paid great attention to the details across the guest room and the flat. I cannot recommend this place if you are looking for a true Brooklyn experience! It is also a bonus that it only takes 15 mins to get to Manhattan!! "
38078	89832741	42581	77256749	Toni	My stay in HopeÂ´s apartment was  great! The apparment is very charming and decorated with a lot of love exactly as shown in the images. The neighborhood is quiet and close to subway stations but nearby are also a lot of restaurants, bares, cafes and stores. Within a 20 minute walk to the East River state park or the rooftop bar at the Wythe Hotel you have a beautiful view on Manhattans skyline especially at sunset! Hope is a very nice person and took very good care of me as her guest. Her welcome package with information on the stay and some tips for things to do nearby was also very helpful. I really enjoyed my time in Hopes appartment and can just highly recommend it to everyone else :-)
38078	93388057	42594	4595091	FÃ¡tima	We had such and oincredible stay in Hope's apartment. The apartment is very bright and clean, and you would have plenty of space in there. Although Hope lives there you would barely notice her, but you can reach here anytime you need.  The room is quite big and the mattress very comfortable, we were travelling with a big luggage and it fitted in perfectly.The apartment is very close to several subway stations that allow you to get around the city very quickly. There are also plenty of restaurants and cafeterias in the area, as well as supermarkets and wine shops.Hope is very welcoming and pays attention to every detail about your stay, and she even took her time to have a drink with us!We hope to be back very soon, and absolutely recommend the apartment.
38078	101111441	42624	66722262	Dominik	We had a really great time staying at Hope's place for a month. She is very helpful, hospitable and cheerful host. The apartment is as shown on the photos: well decorated, cozy, clean and really bright and sunny.  It was high above our expectations. Bedroom is air-conditioned - that let us survive these really hot NYC's nights. The neighborhood is quiet and - what was important - very close to subway station and City Bike station. That was much closer than we've expected. There are lots of bars, restaurants and stores around. Hope's map and guide for guests is very helpful. She recommended us additional things to see and made a perfect two day plan of sightseeing Brooklyn neighborhood for us! Memories of New York City will live with us forever and part of them will be our staying at Hope's place - that's for sure! We can highly recommend this host!
38078	103251973	42634	77116963	Marie	15 days after my come back in France, I always have so many stars which shine in my eyes. My stay on my own for 8 days in Williamsburg at Hope's flat was awesome. Her apartement is so cute, well located, not far from Manhattan, not far from anything, It was so cool. Hope is really welcoming, attentive, easy going. Her recommendations about shops (vintage shops), places to be are significant... She is reachable any time of the day. Even if she is busy, this is a woman who love sharing her love of her city and her Brooklyn attitude ;) As soon as I will come to NY, I will not hesitate, Hope's home would be my first choice. Thank You so much Hope, that was a epic week but truly fantastic xx. Marie, a little french girl for one week in the Big Apple. 
38078	104431363	42639	47643538	Jenny	Hope's apartment was awesome!!  She is the kindest host and I would definitely stay with her again. She offered great recommendations for the neighborhood and the location is great for exploring all parts of the city. Thanks so much, Hope!!!
38078	107533292	42653	3755696	Sarah	Hope is a very nice person, she made us feel at home immediately. Besides the room we could use the kitchen and living room, most of the time we had those spaces to ourselves. The neighborhood is very upcoming, really great, lots of shops and nice places to eat. Subway to Manhattan is close, and there are several lines. We can recommend this place to everyone!
38078	109027285	42661	20779678	Nelson	Hope's place is amazing and in a great location. Kitchen is large with everything you could need. Bed is really comfortable and aircon helped the unusual hot weather we had in fall.Would happily stay again next time I'm in Brooklyn. 
38078	110477749	42669	87016734	Tim	Hope is a great host. She really took care of us and helped us whenever needed so we felt absolutely comfortable in our room. As her flat is located close to the metro it is the perfect starting point for visiting the city or getting a view of Brooklyn!
38078	112756726	42681	11265776	Araceli	Nuestra experiencia en el apartamento ha sido muy buena, nos hemos sentido como en casa porque Hope nos ha dado libertad y confianza total, cediendo todo lo que necesitÃ¡ramos para hacer nuestra estancia mÃ¡s cÃ³moda. Hemos podido usar la cocina y el piso es muy cÃ¡lido, luminoso y acogedor en estos dÃ­as de frÃ­o, lo cual se agradece. Me encanta la zona donde se encuentra el apartamento ya que estÃ¡s a unos minutos a pie de muchas tiendas, locales para tomar copas, cenar o hacer un maravilloso brunch americano, ademÃ¡s de muy buena comunicaciÃ³n en metro para ir a Manhattan (realmente sÃ³lo es cruzar el East River), sin duda repetirÃ­a alojamiento en el mismo barrio. La Ãºnica pega es el horario de check in (a partir de las 7 pm - que sÃ³lo puede ser un problema si llegas muy temprano al aeropuerto y no tiene donde dejar las maletas) o subir los 2 pisos de escaleras ya que no dispone de ascensor. La anfitriona es encantadora, una lÃ¡stima que mi nivel de inglÃ©s sea tan bajo, me hubiera gustado conversar mÃ¡s con ella.
38078	122005432	42724	76289542	Angelika	Hope's apartment was great! It's really pretty, spacious and clean. The bed was very comfy and we had access to the large kitchen and everything we needed. The location is perfect, with just a short walk to the subway as well as to nice restaurants and shops in Williamsburg. Hope was a very kind host and offered great recommendations for the neighborhood - and even welcomed us with a bottle of wine :) We definitely recommend staying at Hope's place!
38078	134683366	42794	2995764	Matt	This place was perfect for my month-long stay, and Hope was a really awesome host!The place is very close to the Williamsburg bridge, giving it great access to Manhattan (less than 10 minutes on the subway). Each day for exercise I took a 2-mile run to the center of the bridge and back to catch a view of the city. There are also cute local bars and coffee shops in walking distance.The room was simple but perfect for my stay, with a very comfortable bed and a desk where I worked most days.Hope is very friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable about the area. She was quick to help with anything I needed for the room, recommendations for things to do, and even had made a book of recommendations for places to eat, get coffee, and go out in Williamsburg.My stay was really great, and I recommend this place very highly!!
38078	137462804	42809	14703118	Anna	Hope's place is lovely and charming, just the same it's host is. It's simply the most beautifully and unique place I can imagine, if you want to enjoy the perfect trip to Brooklyn, with a lot of great places, bars, restaurants around and the perfectly near and easy train connection to Manhattan. We had a very pleasant stay here! 
36170	3259851	41278	3396253	Sonja	We stayed at Dee and Dre's for 2 weeks and it were the most wonderful 2 weeks of our last year - not only because we were in NYC but also due to Dee and Dre's hospitality. During our stay we had the chance to hand out with them several times, they introduced us to their interesting friends and shared their dinner table with us. They are wonderful people and their place is really what it says it is - cozy, friendly and it really does feel like home. Their Chi Chi is also amazing, such a cute dog. The only, but seriously, only sort of negative side to their place is that it's a bit far from downtown by subway, but we had plenty of time on our hands, plus the price beats the distance. 
36170	3970650	41365	1658193	Adrienne	Dee and Dre were wonderful hosts. They both have wonderful hearts and we enjoyed our stay with them.They are both very knowledgeable about the city and getting around.  We were moving from Florida to New York with a very strict budget. Because of them, we were able to make the transition easier. It was both extremely affordable and a good environment. The neighborhood is very family oriented. Its a five minute walk to a bus that will take you to a subway. The metro north train is also five minutes away and can take you into the city in 20 minutes (RECOMMENDED FOR VISITORS). It is near bars and restaurant and has a nice night life but not hectic like the city. Over all our stay was a positive one and Dee and Dre were very good people and lovely hosts! :)
36170	5358713	41450	6375076	Philipp	The reservation was canceled 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
36170	6569577	41503	911155	Chris	Dee and Dre are great hosts...All was as promised and they offered me use of a bike, which I'd planned on taking advantage of, but never did. They have an impressive collection of DVDs in the room for a night in, and there are plenty of Irish bar/grill-type places in the neighborhood to spend a fun night out without going into the city.Thanks guys!
36170	7377635	41534	8569941	Toshi	First of all, thank you so much to Dee and Dre!! You guys were very friendly and helpful that my week went very smoothe and it was a great time :) The house is beautiful and the dog, chi chi is soooo cute and playful. Definitely recommend staying here if you don't mind taking the train into the city.
36170	7628337	41544	5933154	Svenja	I spend a nice week at their house :) also had some really nice dog-company :) the place is very good located to go to the city by bus and walking distance to the main street where you can find anything. Thank you!! :)
36170	8097208	41562	8648137	Belen	La casa estÃ¡ limpia y bien comunicada. 
36170	11307218	41727	8572598	Jen	Dee & Dre were very friendly hosts, and I'm glad to have met them. Their generosity and kindness helped me make it through a stressful week. The location of their home is very convenient to the metro, markets, restaurants, and lovely Irish pubs. The wifi was fast and reliable, and they were even accommodating when I needed to stay a day longer than initially planned.  
36170	12101521	41751	14341559	Jacqueline	Dee and Dre were great hosts! We wished we could have actually spent more time with them (at our fault we were trying to get a lot done in a short amount of time). They were knowledgeable about the city and their house was very much a home with an all around great vibe. The neighborhood felt very safe and quiet and the train ride into the city was inexpensive and so close to the house. I would definitely stay with them again!
36170	13201340	41780	13992091	Neil	I loved my stay here. Dre and Dee were superb welcoming and helpfuk, I was so glad I stayed here especially I booked really short notice. The house is really cool and only a short walk to either the 2 train or the metro north which brings you to Manhattan! Thanks guys really can't praise the place or ye enough.
36170	13855463	41796	4611310	Katie	 We enjoyed our stay. Didn't get to talk to Dee or her husband much because we were always gone (but told us About free day at Bronx Zoo and very helpful with transportation.) They put up with our sometimes whiny 2 year old so we are thankful for that!! Convenient to bus and train lines to Manhattan and not far from Bronx Zoo. Great Irish neighborhood and amazing German bakery close by. Small room with a kid but would be perfect for a couple. Chichi the dog was awesome. It was fun staying in a neighborhood not many tourists get to see. 
36170	14000622	41799	4737969	Nikia	Dee & Dre are great hosts and awesome people. I only stayed with them for two days and only spent a little time there, since I was there for a music festival, but I felt very comfortable. They were so welcoming and their home has so much character. I would love to stay with them again!
36170	15082789	41821	16233963	Gabe	Dee and Dre were really nice and made me feel welcome. The room was great and I slept really well because it felt like a home. Quiet street in a nice neighbourhood and easy for transport. Would come back for sure.
36170	19123450	41889	5906095	Mathilde	Dee and Dre are the most amazing host we had! There home is lovely and you instantly feel like home with them. They were always able to help us in anything we needed, and are always smiling and open! I would definitely recommend to stay with them, and I would love to come back again! Thank you again guys, love from France
36170	19780512	41900	2252187	Brandon	Dee and Dre were very warm and friendly and gracious hosts.  The room is fairly small but with a comfortable futon bed and drawer space, hangers on hooks on the door.  There's a little deck that's nice to sit out on.  And they offered their bikes and tons of movies to watch.  They have a very gregarious and friendly bulldog who seemed quite attached when I was in the main areas.  The neighborhood is friendly and seems safe, sort of a working class Irish American feel with many pubs and delis and a grocery just a few blocks away and a library not far.  It's also conveniently close to the Metro North station and so it's easy to get to the Botanical Garden and Manhattan.  (There's also an Enterprise Rent-a-Car a couple blocks away).  
36170	20169676	41906	718458	Deniz	Dee&Dre were very helpful and eager to answer all of our questions about the area. The room was clean, convenient for a couple and the bed was comfy. We had everything we needed. Their big, funny dog Chichi was so cute and happy to see us every time we entered the house! The neighborhood was safe and very close to a nice Irish area with great Irish pubs and a nice diner. It is a bit far from downtown Manhattan, about 45 mins by subway, 1 hour by bus, or if you catch the train it is 25 mins to Grand Central.Overall it was a nice and cozy stay with Dee&Dre. Definitely recommended.
36170	20471605	41911	21655037	Ross	Dee and Dre were VERY helpful and courteous.I was getting to the city by train, and had a 4 hour delay!! They stayed up to make sure I got in and settled comfortably.They provided plenty of space and I was able to leave and return with no problem my entire stay.
36170	20628416	41914	3048003	Didar	Dee & Dre are very welcoming and great host. The house has its own unique characteristics with carefully chosen interior color theme and artifacts that give you  meditative effect. I only get to crash at night after work and it's conveniently located close to metro north station that works out very well for me. I highly recommend the space.
36170	21015042	41921	3048003	Didar	Great host! Great apartment and neighbourhood
36170	21230209	41925	57027	John	I'd be happy to return! Ideal if you want inexpensive lodging with a laid back, friendly couple in a very safe neighborhood about 30 min from Grand Central. I found the futon comfortable and made fast friends with Chi Chi, Dee and Dre's friendly and loving bull dog. Dee or Dre kindly share homemade pumpkin cake. My only regret is that our schedules didn't coincide so we didn't have time together. PS Their slogan is Live noble! I agree :)
36170	21541028	41931	22017023	Amy	Dee and Dre were great hosts. Although we weren't around much, they didn't mind our 2am arrivals back at the house. We are smitten with their dog, Chichi!  Total love bug. I would definitely stay there again!! 
36170	22050855	41940	20780000	Shannon	Great suburb, quick train to the city & bak, great pubs. & restaurants near by, the place was very arty which we love, the room was very spacey for us both, beautiful people, we were in & out all the time and they didn't mind at all, also they have a beautiful dog Chichi, we adored him and wanted to bring him home hehehe thanks for having us guys :-) 
36170	22207300	41944	16645627	Trisha	Nice clean room and the hosts were very nice and helpful! 
36170	23774601	41982	17008763	Radhika	Thank you Dee&Dre for the experience.  Appreciate your help. 
36170	31030499	42125	25458953	Emre	I stayed with Dee, Dre and their dog named Chi Chi for 65 days. They were very friendly to me. They have a very cute private home which has 2 floors in Woodlawn. Andreaâ??s mummy lives in the first floor. She helped me about everything especially to wash my clothes in washer. Woodlawn is a very safe and funny Irish area. In addition, there are many Irish pubs and restaurants around. However Iâ??ve spent my  best times with Chi Chi. We loved each other very much. I miss you so much Chi Chi.
36170	32656127	42143	24638942	Shaohuai	Great host!! Dee and Dre were super helpful. The room is arty.  2mins walk to metro north station which takes you to Manhattan in 20mins or you can have a 10mins walk to the MTA subway station.  Neighbour hood are quiet with great pub and restaurants.  Moreover, their dog, Chichi, so cute and funny. Overall every was great!!
36170	32821217	42146	27897306	Susy	Lovely young couple, with a beautiful friendly dog.  Nicely decorated, and lots of books and DVD's if one chooses to partake.  Clean and comfortable.  Nice neighbourhood and easy to get around.
36170	33701991	42155	30723031	Raymond	Great place to stay, Dee & Dre are very friendly and helpful. And if there is no one home, there is always Chi Chi to welcome you. Its a quiet neighborhood with all essentials close by.
36170	34345806	42162	33974435	Kelly	"We had the best experience with Dee and Dre. Talk about amazing energy. They really understand how to let you be in their space perfectly. They were always friendly, always genuine and were really good about reading our energy. Seriously, it didn't even feel like we were ""staying at someone else's place"". I just wish we could have had more conversations with them because they were so interesting and kind. It was a hectic week for my partner and I, moving to New York City and they made us feel right at home. I recommend staying with them to anyone. "
36170	39466398	42208	25512487	Rodrigo	I had a great time! I'll definitely visit then again. They made fell like home! Thank you!
36170	40137543	42213	37730734	Yesenia	Dee and Dre were great host and made us feel right at home, even when one of us had a very embarrassing situation happen. Chi chi was the sweetest and added some funny stories for us. Absolutely love the neighborhood , it's a little Ireland . Had a lot of little mom and pop stores that were great! Place was clean and as described, fairly close to the 2 train which brings you to the city and all the major tourist spots. 
36170	41549594	42223	25512487	Rodrigo	They are super hosts! My second time here and I fell like home! I'll definitely be here again! Thanks guys!
36170	42878105	42232	8868052	Anna	My friend and I had a very pleasant stay.  The neighborhood was lovely and though we were gone most of the day and night working we slept very well and always felt welcomed and comfortable. Dee and Dre are very nice and accommodating hosts!
36170	48305985	42272	28915134	Kimia	I did a rotation at Montefiore for the month. The neighborhood was safe and parking was plenty. They really made me feel at home. It is more personal than most airb&b places which was nice. 
36170	48816326	42275	35921574	Tanique	Dee and Dre were awesome!  My friend and I arrived a bit late but they were very accommodating.  We barely saw them but when we did interact with them they were very kind and helpful.  The home is very cozy and unique with beautiful art work and bright, cheery colors.  The room we stayed in was a nice size.  We were not cramped.  The area is beautiful and the residents are very friendly.  The bus and train are conveniently located a few blocks away from the home.  AND their dog Chi Chi is so playful.  We fell in love.  I would totally recommend this place to anyone who is visiting the NYC and looking for a great deal for a low price.  
36170	50233590	42287	45538826	Elkie	Dee and Andre were very hospitable, accommodating, gracious hosts. Very attentive and helpful.  Public transportation is within reasonable walking distance from their home (both Metro-North and the subway), as well as a supermarket. Highly recommended hosts!
36170	50568832	42289	40909390	Carmen	Dee and Dre were great hosts. they were very welcoming and their home is very creatively decorated. Their pet ChiChi is a beautiful and friendly pet. The space was minutes away from the Bronx Botanical garden, close to movie theaters and the shopping plaza.   
36170	52323534	42305	24103205	Ayesha	I stayed with Dee & Dre for two weeks this October. they've been so helpful throughout my experience. Communicating during and before hand wasn't difficult at all which is always a bonus. Both Dee & Dre made me feel very welcome in their home. The description hits the nail on the head, its a wonderful, clean, colourful and art-filled home. Woodlawn is a great area, lots of bars, restaurants, cafes whichever way you go. I found the subway system easy to find and pick up by the end of my first day. Overall, I had a wonderful time out in the Bronx with these guys and am grateful it was them I got to stay with. 
36170	57497525	42364	840402	Winsome	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
36170	83275081	42553	5200781	Donna	It's a place to stay. Basement. Just don't expect great connectivity - through the phone, the internet, or even with the hosts. It took a full day for the Dee & Dre to return my email regarding my connectivity issues (which I wrote on my phone, from the street). I booked for 3 days. Fortunately a friend offered me a couch for one day and I took it, because in visiting my elderly mother, using the phone and the internet were essential. Oh, and the rooms are next to the laundry room, so there are laundry smells.  
36170	86214024	42566	26869379	Terry	The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
36170	89272697	42578	22420215	Lisa	Dee and Dre were great. They showed us places in the area to eat and shop locally and provided us with menus from different places to order. We felt at home as they provided us with complete privacy during our stay.
36170	90208453	42582	85539430	Joanne	Everything was as stated in the listing. It was a very comfortable stay for us. Dre was great and accommodating. This is much better then staying in a hotel because of the extra amenities and it feels like home. There wasn't air conditioning which may be an issue for those with certain medical conditions but since it's located in the basement it was cooler. We were provided a fan and were comfortable. Would definitely recommend.
36170	91413557	42587	60035603	Ibrahim	They were very nice and very welcoming. The place was very cleaned and it was really beautiful. The Hosts were always available and they even helped to get the taxi service to go to the airport. 
36170	92171103	42589	80505574	Natalia	Due to last minute changes we didn't end up staying there. They were super friendly and quick when communicating. 
36170	94661113	42598	74877530	Chinwe	Spent a weekend here with one guest and we enjoyed our stay. The apartment is located in a nice neighborhood and it was fairly easy to commute to the city from here (metronorth is 20 mins and on the weekends, the tickets are cheaper). There's good food options around and there's a private entrance to the apt. The space in the apt is perfect for two people, however this was a basement apt and there were 'basement smells' I'm not sure how to describe it but they provided incense so we used it to mask the smell. Also our pillow cases weren't as fresh smelling but the bed sheets were fine. All in all for the price, this Airbnb was a steal and I would gladly go back. 
36170	95999415	42603	82122410	Iva	Dee and Dre are super cool and very pleasant to work with. There was a lot of free water in fridge! The space was cute and comfortable. Something I missed in the description is that there is no a/c in this basement apartment... which was unfortunate due to the mid-August heat wave we were experiencing . There was a small fan to use, thankfully. The place is about a 10 min walk to a 2 train, which was convenient to get to Manhatten. Overall, I was pleased with my stay and would stay there again in the future :)
36170	97923848	42611	87495440	Elvis	Dee and Dre were so welcoming, they ve waited for us even if we came very Late due to flight delays. The place Was very Clean and comfy, my daughter loved it. The neighborhood is very calm and safe. I recommend this lovely couple and their lovely place.
36170	101840686	42628	17445687	Amela	Very nice and friendly...supporting and available whenever I had any question
36170	102261306	42630	94882131	Lauren	Dee and Dre's place was just what we needed for our quick stay in NY. They were both super helpful and kept in contact throughout the whole process. Very good people that you can trust. 
36170	102898340	42632	5808820	Ekaterina	This place is very far from the city center. it took me 5!!! hours to get from the airport to the flat. The public transport going there only every 30 min. The neighborhood is too quiet, there is not much to see or to do. This place is not a good place to explore NYC. I rented the flat for 2 nights and decided to leave after the first one. I preferred to pay a night in a hotel, then waisting my time there.Despite kind help of Dee and Dre and clearness of the flat, I do not recommend this place to stay if you would like see NYC. 
36170	104631234	42640	28016280	Janice	They were very warm people and greeted me when I arrived. I felt comfortable instantly.
36170	106682600	42650	27519817	RÃ©gis	It was so wonderful to discover New York and The Bronx from your apartement, from your Town. Thanks for your support and your ideas before we arrived. Your home is so nice. Maybe one day, we will more discover the Dre's creations. Take care. Bye. 
36170	106870764	42651	38391739	Karen	Very clean and comfortable. Close to the train station. 
36170	107440923	42653	38391739	Karen	Very comfortable. Cell service did not work in areas of the apartment possibly due to the basement location. Wi fi worked great and hosts were very available. 
36170	110169728	42667	95193562	Christian	Great place, I stayed in three spots during my trip in NY, and this was my favorite. Great vibe and great hosts 
36170	113726570	42687	410927	Valerie	The neighborhood was very pleasant with Metro North trains and a breakfast place an both easy to walk to.  This was our first Airbnb experience and doesn't bode well for future stays.  The space is exactly as photographed and it's obvious that a lot has gone into making the space clean and comfortable.  Photos can't capture the dank moldy odor in the basement apartment or the dark depressing atmosphere.   I have asthma that was irritated by the air quality and couldn't spend the weekend.  We left after the first night and went to a hotel.   When you consider the cost of this vs a clean modern Comfort Inn with free breakfast it's not a very good value at all.  
36170	116336234	42703	24669337	Lisa	This place was a gem! Dee & Dre pay attention to little details and have decorated the space beautifully. The unit was very clean and just as pictured. For travelers traveling in winter - the floor is beautiful tiles, but can be a little cold at night - I'd recommend bringing slipper socks or slippers. I loved the shower! It had this cool lighted shower head that indicated the temp of the water! Great food nearby, and quick walk to the train.  The hosts were very accommodating of our much later arrival time due to airport delays and even checked in via text to make sure we got in ok.  Overall, a great experience for me, my partner, and cat. 
36170	116546920	42705	68440174	Anna	Super convenient to Montefiore for an interview that I had :) comfy towels, yoga music, really cute space for me and my friend. Would absolutely stay again for another visit to the Bronx.
36170	116782004	42707	21922997	Briana	This place is great for a getaway, nice neighborhood. Everything you need within walking distance. Dee and Dre were very nice and I would love to stay there again for a getaway!
36170	120176172	42712	19323104	Eva	Stayed here for 4 nights in December 2016 and had a fabulous stay! We thought the place was way bigger than the pictures online which was a great bonus! It has absolutely everything you could need and Dee and Dre have thought of everything. From the toiletries in the bathroom to the extra towels to the spare blankets and fluffy socks. We used the place as a base for exploring the city and found it easy to get to from the apartment. It is about a 10 minute walk to the subway or a 5min walk to the MTA. On the subway it is about 40min to times square so if you don't mind the commute this is the place to stay! It is definitely worth the commute for the amount of space you get. They also supplied a selection of DVDs and take out menus and even a popcorn machine so you could really chill out after a long day of sightseeing. Really couldn't recommend the place enough and if you don't mind the journey on the subway this is absolutely the place to stay! The apartment was lovely and warm and so private. We didn't see the hosts during our stay but they were easily contactable if we needed them. Also the wifi was great, we had no issues at all during our stay.
36170	120448286	42714	95494303	Carmen	Place was amazing and extremely cozy,  it was located in a very quiet and secluded area. 
36170	120730872	42715	60830411	Evelyn	It was a very lovely stay even though it was short. This is an incredibly cozy cute basement apartment and we enjoyed our stay. It's a bit cold but at least the main bedroom had its own heating. Overall it was nice. 
36170	122018035	42724	92360079	Geraldine	Secluded, cozy apartment. Definitely get a car if you're moving around. Dre and Dee were great hosts 
36170	123289408	42732	58867515	Jodie	Great
36170	123762299	42734	106721784	Stephen	We really enjoyed our stay here.  It is very convenient for making use of public transit, so we didn't need to drive while we were there.  The neighborhood is quiet and safe with easy access to groceries and restaurants. They were very responsive to any questions we had.  My kids loved the light up shower head.  A great value. We would stay here again.
36170	124747446	42737	108307583	Goutam	It was a very pleasant stay at Dee & Dre's place. They provided us with everything we needed and the room was cozy and comfortable. Would definitely recommend this place for stay.
36170	126012023	42743	14610572	Chris	Dee & Dre's were great and their place was terrific :-)  It's a cozy space that's very home-y. And it's just two blocks from all the restaurants and bars on Katonah Ave! 
36170	127217921	42751	69066955	Joseph	Because I am very familiar with the area, Dre & Dee gave me the thing I  required most - peace and privacy. Because the space was so nice, I spent most of my visit wanting to be back in their home so I could relax.
36170	129167682	42764	107155820	Patrick	Nice and quiet, no problems at all and a lovely area 
36170	132070017	42781	112951763	Monique	Dee & Dre's place was very cozy, very creatively decorated, and very clean. I had a very nice stay. If you're looking for a nice comfy stay and wouldn't mind some great paintings, Dee & Dre's is the place for you! 
36170	133075069	42786	55445617	Kevin	Neighborhood was very nice and a short walk to the subway. 
36170	133574891	42789	13716251	Jordyn	Dee and Dre were great hosts! We only saw Dee a handful of times but she was also available via text message and were very accommodating.House: Bigger than the pictures! Even with a basement apartment there was ample lighting. The bedroom had more than enough room and our son loved being able to choose another bed each night. The pull out being huge. We loved the board games and the wii. Be mindful there isn't a exhaust over the stove so the smoke alarm goes off. Opening the door helps. The bathroom is huge with a cute work out space in the back a standing shower and huge sink. For those with epilepsy or photo sensitivity the shower head turns different colors to tell you hot or cold. And there were a group of flies but Overall for two adults and energetic 6 year old and our dog this place was very accommodating.Location: Perfect for us to commute to work in Harlem and Manhattan with busses, metro north and the 2 train. The park is right there and with Irish neighborhood it's so easy to grab a drink or a bite to eat literally two blocks away with a c town and pet store.We would definitely recommend this place and stay here again we love the positive energy and the decorations are artsy and went along with the same vibe as our family. Thank you Dee and Dre for opening your home to us - The Davis Family
36170	134494248	42793	117392733	Korab	Great place and privacy! Awesome host!
36170	137993967	42812	117545659	Mason	Great place. Very comfortable and homey. Metro is close can take it all the way to grand central station and a little further down is the subway if you want a cheaper route. There is wine bottle opener on the premise so no worries my friends. A great place to stay and Dee and Dre are very attentive we had no issues during our stay 
36170	138394583	42813	71216399	Katelyn	The best part about Dee & Dre's place is the great location! It's just 2 blocks from Katonah Ave which is where all the bars and restaurants are. Love that we could walk everywhere. The cute basement apartment is much bigger than the pictures show. It has anything you might need for your stay. I would definitely recommend to anyone needing a place in the area! 
28161	65150031	42440	27932675	Sandra	Staying at Anthony's apartment was just perfect. Such a great location very close to the subway station, amazing bars and restaurants, shops, just everything. Anthony was a great host and very friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend staying at Anthony's apartment. 
28161	75752659	42512	71302786	Shanna	This 2B duplex in Nolita exceeded our expectations!   We absolutely loved the street and neighborhood.  It doesn't have the touristy feel, so we felt like we really experiencing what it was like to live in NYC.  The street is very quiet with hardly any traffic and it is super close to subway and grocery stores.  A bonus is that there is a charming little cafe next door that has delicious sandwiches.  The actual apartment felt huge for NYC!  More than enough room for our family of 4 (kids ages 10 and 7).  The beds were really comfortable and the shower had good water pressure and temp.  It was really nice to have a fridge and oven to make use of leftovers.  I'd definitely stay here again with my family and would highly recommend to a friend.  
28161	81091717	42541	5294657	Nathalie	Anthony was very timely and helpful in his responses to our questions. The stay was seamless, the apartment clean and in an excellent location. My family and I had a fabulous weekend in NY. 
28161	99662243	42618	1507966	Joseph	The apartment was exactly per photos.  Ground floor with basement bedrooms. Incredible location. Great host. 
28161	108547939	42659	5200252	Jenny	fantastic location, loved the convenience. great apartment. the bedrooms could be a bit bigger, but that's par for the course in NYC. overall great experience, would highlight recommend. 
28161	115673186	42700	27340299	Ryan	Great apartment in a perfect location. Amazing restaurants and shopping and subway very close by. And the 2 level apt makes it feel bigger. Love the apartment!  Thanks for hosting us!
633	72392050	42492	49454630	Konstantin	We had a good stay at Sarah's place â?? nice roommates, close to the beach. Great!
633	87087141	42569	81348449	Ken	Sarah's place is lovely. Her apartment is spacious, quiet, clean, her room gets tons of light, and she and her roommates are lovely. Not to mention, her place is barely a 5 minute walk from the beach, if that's your thing. My stay was so peaceful, that I was able to finish the first draft of a play that I'd been working on for months...okay, okay, years. This is all to say, I would recommend staying at Sarah's place without reservation.
20992	163782	40546	273715	Giulia	The City Room Private Suite is excellent!!!!It is very big, comfortable, well-furnished; it has a private bathroom very clean and nice.The house is pretty, located in a pretty area just north of Central Park, you can find everything you need in the nearer!Wayne, the owner, is a very kind man, helpful and friendly.It was a great location in NYC! Very recomendable!
20992	250568	40666	526615	Autumn	"Hello my fellow ""AirBnBers"", It is with great excitement that I write this review. Wayne is a wonderful host and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay in his clean and comfortable suite. I will break this down to a couple of areas that I think will interest most people: Location, Safety, Cleanliness, Host Attitude. Location- This beautiful brownstone is situated in Harlem on W. 129th street  which is only a VERY short walk to the 125th street train station that takes you straight to Manhattan. It is also only about 10 minutes by car from the Bronx just over the 145th street bridge. There are plenty of restaurants located nearby and a corner store that sells daily needs at the end of the block. I recommend Sylvia's Soul food restaurant which I walked to in about 5 minutes (yes, it is the same Sylvia that owns the canned food chain!). One afternoon, I took a walk just to see what I could see and within less than 15 minutes, I ran into the Apollo Theatre...What a treat!Safety- Wayne's house is in a very nice area of Harlem. The street was quiet and I was able to park on the street in front of the house ALL weekend. Now maybe, I just got lucky but I would suggest parking your car for the weekend anyway. I mean, it's NYC! Use public transportation and take the time to look around as you stroll to your destinations. You will feel very safe staying here and there are a total of 3 locked doors (Wayne provides keys) that you enter before you even get to your room door, which also locks, so I truly couldn't have felt safer.Cleanliness- Being the paranoid type when it comes to sleeping in other people's spaces, I brought my own sheets and towels but after I saw how clean Wayne kept the place, I used his! The room was spotless and there were what seemed like new sheets on the bed. He also provided two sets of fresh towels, hand towels, washcloths, and a new bar of Dove soap. Finally, Host Attitude. What can I say? Wayne is very friendly and willing to answer any questions that you have. He asked me at least 3 times if we were comfortable in the room throughout the weekend which really made me feel like he was sincere. My one concern prior to arriving was that I am a bit of a partier and I was looking for a place that I could come and go as I pleased without any issue. Wayne's place was ideal. I came in around the middle of the night twice during my weekend with him and it was no problem plus he gives you a key so you don't have to bother him to get in. Of course you should come in quietly if it's late, but we are all adults so that should be obvious. Overall, my ONLY regret was that I didn't get to spend a little more time getting to know my host (my fault not his). I had jam-pack pre-planned my weekend so I didn't have much spare time. That was a mistake because after meeting him, he seems like a really cool guy to have as a friend and it would have been nice to have grabbed lunch or coffee or something. I look forward to my next stay in Harlem as it will most definitely be at Wayne's!"
20992	253688	40669	99487	Calvin	Wayne was the perfect host. The room was clean and spacious and nice.He was so caring asking me if I needed anything. Especially for me to need a place so last minute he was there to offer me a place. Anytime i need him he was always by his phone. I got to check as soon as possible which was brilliant. And I left at anytime I needed. He even texted me to make sure I was on the bus going back home safely.
20992	266735	40679	115528	Latasha	My stay at Wayne's place was absolutely great!!  He's warm and welcoming!  The suite was perfect and exactly what I was looking for!  I HIGHLY recommend his place and most certainly will stay whenever I go to NYC!!
20992	275442	40685	588726	William	This being my first airbnb experience, I wasn't quite sure what to expect - would I get a slumlord or a comparable room to a hotel?  What if I pay and then this person disappears leaving me with an even more expensive trip to NYC?  Well, these fears were instantly diverted with the constant communication by the host leading up to the stay.  Any question I had was answered within a relatively short time frame and I was certain my stay was going to be perfectly acceptable... that is, until I arrived in NY and noticed the area I would be staying in... Harlem!?Well, I don't know about anyone else but I have seen movies regarding Harlem in the 80s and once again my fears of a poor weekend showed up.  Well those fears were instantly allayed upon arrival.  The area appeared clean and the neighbors helpful.  Wayne further put the fear to rest mentioning how the neighborhood has changed a fair amount from the days of the 80s, of course I had to see for myself so out I went.The first night there at around 7PM, I walked to Central Park (nine blocks away!) and wandered around for a while until about 9PM then it was time to start hitting up some lounges.  First stop of the night was The Chocolate Lounge (3 blocks away (URL HIDDEN) not a bad little hang out, stylish decor and friendly people, I managed to walk in right in the middle of a speed dating event and no one seemed to mind while even introducing me to some of the guests.  Next stop of the night, around 11ish, I wandered on over to ALoft (also 3 or 4 blocks away (URL HIDDEN)  At the base of Aloft is a pretty nice little lounge (wxyz) where guests and neighbors alike gather to mingle.  I stayed there until about 1ish when I decided to go hunt down some NY Pizza  and ended up at Five Star Fried Chicken-Pizza - delicious!  This took me to about 2:30 am or so when I decided it was time to hit the hay.The next morning I went for a run in Central Park (I have always wanted to do this) and spent the rest of the day exploring NYC.  I ended up back in the area around 11pm or so where I hit up the Lenox Lounge (URL HIDDEN) for some good ol Harlem Jazz where I stayed until 4am before deciding to head back to Wayne's.The third and final day, I spent some time over in Riverside Park (where I had to walk through the projects to get to) and then spent the rest of the day in Central Park before heading back to Wayne's to pick up my bags and head down to the M60 bus (four blocks away and a direct line to Laguardia! for $3!).Now, it would seem that I didn't talk about a lot of my trip during this review but the main point was to discuss the area.  I was out at all times of the day (early morning, mid-morning, afternoon, evening, late evening and really early in the morning) and in many parts (north central park, central/east/west harlem, the projects, etc...) and there was not one point where I felt my safety was compromised.  I'm glad I didn't let my previous notion of Harlem get in the way of what turned out to be an awesome trip!Outside of all this - Wayne was a great host - he kept in constant communication leading up to my stay, he was there when I arrived and seemed genuinely interested in how my stay was going and went.  Overall - my first bnb experience was a success thanks to an awesome host and a great city.
20992	283413	40690	510796	Huguette	I had a wonderful time in NY while staying at Wayne's house. I finally went to the private apartment and it was amazing how it was cosy, clean, spacious and very confortable. I was feeling home! Wayne is a wonderful and great host, kind, always putting our needs first and most of all available for any questions. The area is safe anytime and close to the 125 street wich is one of the most popular street in NY. There is plenty of good restaurants around and it s at only 15 min from Midtown with the express trains. many buses..I mean if you want to spend a good time in NY with the best quality of housing at an affordable price ( and save money for shopping and so on ...), then Wayne's house is a very good compromise. He took care of us so kindly that it was hard for us to leave NYC..:-(..So thanks again Wayne !!! 
20992	286776	40692	366035	Toni	Wayne was great. After travelling across town to meet up with us, he let us into a very nice room with everything needed for a comfortable stay. Super clean, lovely room, very peaceful. Loved the cat as well, super friendly. Next time we are in NY, please keep us a room Wayne!
20992	300627	40700	552060	Steven	Wayne,Has a wonder place, clean and a great location nice area with a lot to do. I would recommend his place and would stay with him again.Steven
20992	340454	40722	636010	Carrie	Wayne was an amazing host. He was accommodating in every area possible, like giving us great local hot spots to go. The room is very clean and much bigger than I thought it was going to be. Wayne was a great host to stay with and we hope to stay with him again soon. 
20992	362287	40733	692615	Melinda	Wayne and Scooby (the cat) were great hosts!  Wayne made me feel right at home.  Every day, he checked to see how I was doing and as a parting gift, he gave me some of the yummiest carrot cake that I have ever tasted!  He was also very helpful regarding info on the best restaraunts and sites to see in the city.  My room was huge, clean, and air conditioned (it was hot and humid the three days I was there). The location was close to public transportation, and local restaraunts and shops. I would highly recommended staying in the City Room and I plan on staying there during my next visit to NYC.
20992	372930	40738	702189	Fede	This appartment is perfect for a couple looking for a reasonably priced place to stay in NYC. The room is quite big, and so is the bathroom. There's also air conditioning so you get to sleep comfortably. Wayne is a great host, he's friendly and it's really interesting to chat with him. I stayed there with my girlfriend and we had a great time. It's just a few blocks away from 2 subway stations and you can get to midtown in a few minutes. We would definetely stay there on our next visit to NYC.
20992	385643	40744	769648	Megan	The room was very spacious and brighter than the pictures convey. Wayne prepared the room well so that it was clean and comfortable. I enjoyed the neighborhood - Harlem felt calmed down compared to south Manhattan. Wayne was a very welcoming host. 
20992	391980	40747	837025	Keith	Being that this was my first time using Airbnb I had my own trepidations about staying in someone's apartment, but those feelings were put to rest almost the instant I walked into the suite.  Wayne did a great job connecting with me the morning I arrived and informed me of how I could access the apartment and had specific instructions that were concise and easy to follow.  The room is just what the picture showed and this set me to ease that this wasn't a 'stock' photo being used for multiple rooms.  The room I saw online was the room I was in.  Everyone else is correct when they say that the apartment is in a great location, 4 blocks from the 2/3 trains and mere minutes to the heart of downtown.  I would recommend that anyone young or old look into using this service, I will check Airbnb for possible places to stay on my next trips.  The price was right, the room clean, had it's own bathroom and was air conditioned. Thank you for a great stay Wayne.
20992	585991	40817	1000262	Eva	Hospedarse en  Harlem ha sido una experiencia positiva, y nos ha dado la posibililad de conocer una zona mÃ¡s tranquila que el bullicioso centro.   El apartamento de Wayne estÃ¡ muy bien comunicado, con linia de metro cerca que va directa a Times Square. La habitaciÃ³n era muy grande, limpia y comfortable. Pero lo mejor es la atenciÃ³n de Wayne que siempre estÃ¡ dispuesto a ayudar y que desde el primer momento te hace sentir como si estuvieras en tu propia casa. TambiÃ©n evaluo de forma positiva la posibilidad de conocer a  otros huÃ©spedes en el  apartamento. Gracias Wayne!!
20992	597414	40820	1031411	Jennifer	It was an awesome stay. We had such a great room, were very flexible because of the close subway station and we had an amazing host who was very helpful.
20992	605228	40822	994045	Jude	Felt like a hotel suite; clean, comfortable and just plain great. Wayne was flexible and really cool. I arranged a late arrival and he met me at the door, gave me a tour and made me feel really welcome. I would stay again!
20992	661930	40841	237388	Giampaolo	I can but confirm what all the other guests wrote about Wayne: 1) the room and the bathroom are nice and clean; 2) I did appreciate the accommodation area, close and easy from everything; 3) the room was exactly as described, minutes from the subway; 4) Wayne was a very welcoming host and made me fell right at home from the beginning; 5) beyond any stupid prejudice, in Harlem I felt very save as a clean and agile neighborhood.So, I definitely recommend to be hosted by Wayne. 
20992	675732	40846	1193190	St	Wayne is a warm, friendly and very likeable host, and made a world of difference to our experience in New York. We were late in coming back the first night as we got a little lost, and he took the trouble to wait up for us. It was great to be able to chat with him, though we felt bad for keeping him up late at night (the next day was a working day). The room was clean, spacious and comfortable, exactly as depicted in the photos. Kudos to Wayne and we wish him all the best!
20992	714257	40860	1334292	Linda	Wayne, I love you to pieces. Wayne was accommodating in person as well as helping me navigate through the oh so confusing airbnb website interactions. I didn't find the website intuitive what-so-ever, but Wayne on the other hand, was easy to figure out! :) The place was clean and convenient to the subway. Harlem is charming. Wayne is a dear soul with a sweet and easy smile. I really enjoyed staying in the apartment, it was spacious and had everything I needed. Peace, Linda
20992	1164986	41021	2117932	Ijeoma	Wayne was a lovely host. He was available for questions and directions. The room was big, cosy and neat. I really enjoyed my stay. However, i was a bit wary abut the neighbourhood especially as i come back at nights. I also got a lot of cautions from people who learnt i was staying there. Apart from this, i enjoyed my stay.
20992	1232010	41034	2211828	Karim	Wayne was very accommodating, understanding, flexible, and cool. He went out of his way several times for me. Place was clean and just like the picsThe Harlem Renaissance is just that and itâ??s a cool neighborhood to check out. Lots of great restaurants and things to do; I'd recommend the Red Rooster.
20992	1452365	41070	2528648	Bernadette	Very good place. Wayne is a nice guy....Very calm and helpfull.
20992	1993969	41136	2928463	McFlein	Wayne se ha preocupado en todo momento por mejorar nuestra experiencia. Si bien hay que reconocer que al comienzo todo fue un poco caÃ³tico, porque la habitaciÃ³n estaba a medio preparar. Pero fue solo en los primeros momentos. DespuÃ©s la cosa cambiÃ³ bastante. Conocimos a otras inquilinas muy simpÃ¡ticas, tambiÃ©n de EspaÃ±a, y otra mÃ¡s de Francia. AdemÃ¡s hay buena comunicaciÃ³n en metro con el resto de manhattan e incluso con el JFK. Â¡Cuidado que scooby (el gato) puede colarse en tu cuarto a travÃ©s de la ventana!
20992	2129284	41149	3029889	Deza	I spent a week with my friend at City Room - Private Luxury Suite. Wayne is a great host as well as his son, Malcolm who welcomed us and made a tour with us in Harlem and in Broadway the first day. Wayne was helpful and flexible. He found a solution that avoids us of carrying my wheelchair up and down every day; this was so great! It's a cool neighborhood, nice people, easy for transportation, many restaurants: we specially loved eating at Jacob's and we appreciated the Jazz band at the Shrine. I'd definitely recommend.
20992	2369585	41174	2998752	Kamel & Hanane	Our experience at Wayne's place was great!The suite was clean and comfortable. Wayne is an excellent host, accomodating and cool. Harlem is a lively and safe neighbourhood. The subway, a few blocks away brings you quickly  to midtown andowntown NYC.For sure, we warmly recommend Wayne's house for a trip in NYC.
20992	2424556	41178	936431	David	I was surprised by how convenient it was staying on 129th. 8 minute walk to 125th to catch 2 or 3 express. Either one gets you to Times Square in 20 minutes. Since I had meetings at 92nd Y and midtown worked great. Wayne was flexible on late check in. Private room and bath is like a hotel but your in a brownstone looking out on garden. This is great deal
20992	2520758	41188	2918458	Julia	That was my first experience with AirBnB and it was extremely positive!!!! Wayne is a wonderful host, very open, helpful and welcoming. We've got a room like in a hotel, but it was much better, since we've got an access to the kitchen. Assuming: room - excellent hotel-style room for 1/3 of the price of a hotel; location - 5 minutes on foot to the nearest subway, 15 minutes by subway to the Times Square; Wayne's hospitality, wine-tasting at the kitchen and chatting with guests around the world - priceless!
20992	2548228	41190	487874	Latoya	I enjoyed my stay at Wayne's place. It was very clean and I felt safe in the neighborhood. I would definitely return.  Wayne was available whenever I contacted him and also very organized. 
20992	2595975	41195	3483773	Andrei	"We were well received by Wayne and some friends after 12 hours flight and following the best instructions as it could be precise and also cheap to get from Newark to his house!! the flat is absolutelly as in the pictures and we had the opportunitty to use his kitchen for breakfeast and some quick dinner. Everything as avaiable and as Waine said "" mi Casa su Cas"". he relaxed us about the area and transport and there not even one time that we meet him after a long day of walking and he asked about how was it and where we were.thanks for welcoming us and I hop when you decide to came to the other side of the North Atantic Sea we can see each other..  Wishing you the best from the first guest to have pickels for breakfeast Andrei and Deora"
20992	2635046	41198	3728868	Georgianna	Wayne is super cool! The room was exactly what we expected from the picture. It was very comfortable and the neighbourhood was very cool. 
20992	2684088	41204	642967	Daniel	Just want to give a heartfelt thanks to Wayne and his team for a wonderful stay. Despite my travel schedule pushing our arrival past our original meeting time, Wayne graciously arranged our later check in time. My wife, and 3 month old had a wonderful time in the quiet, clean and accessible location. The room is more spacious than the pictures show - what a pleasant surprise :) The neighborhood is lively, but the street is quiet in the evening for a good night's sleep, with good accessibility to transportation and good eateries nearby. Highly recommended!
20992	2800329	41217	2247796	Florence	I highly recommand WaynÃ¨'s place, it's clean, quiet and comfy!! you would never have such a good quality in a hotel!!!!Wayne is very nice and helpful and the neighborhood is just great! That's real NYC, nice people and good restaurants.We'll come back!
20992	2951779	41237	4028182	Betsy	From the moment I arrived, Wayne and Corrine were very friendly and inviting.  The room was great and very clean.  The best was the privacy that I had with a private bathroom in my room.The location was perfect and close to public transportation and shopping area.  All types of food just a short walk away.  I had the best time and would definitely stay here again.  Thanks so much Wayne!
20992	3121487	41262	3217857	Emily	We stayed in Wayne's apartment for 3 nights.  It was really great - pretty much like a hotel room with the en-suite bathroom and mini fridge.  It was very spacious and the bed was comfortable. The location is great - within walking distance to both the 4/5/6 and the 2/3 subway lines and in a vibrant neighborhood with shops, restaurants, bars, and music venues.  Wayne was a great host - he gave us lots of restaurant recommendations and even offered to send a jacket that we forgot in the room. He was very communicative and check in/check out was easy.  A great alternative to overpriced hotel rooms further south in Manhattan!  We would definitely stay here again. 
20992	3205425	41275	3210855	Suelen	It was our first Airbnb experience and I think the worry is the same of all: security, location and host cancel your reservation and let you down. Well, with Wayne you donÂ´t need to worry about none of this! Our stay was perfect, the house is near of several metro stations and Wayne (and Corine) are great! NYC is perfect and you have so many things to do that just only using the room to sleep, but you still feel so comfortable as in a really good hotel, paying far less. In an upcoming trip to NY for sure I'll be in Wayne`s house again. Highly recommended! Thanks again for everything Wayne, Your friends from BrazilSuelen and Thiago.
20992	3263261	41278	4059671	Kord	Wayne's place is accurately described on Airbnb. He is a wonderful host with a property located in a great location. His property is conveniently located near the subway and the M60 if flying into LGA. Despite the stigma on the area (HARLEM USA), not once did me or my girlfriend feel endangered. We were able to have somewhere cozy and comfortable to stay without any problems. Wayne is a generous host who was always available when needed. Even though you don't get the entire apt to yourself, privacy is respected. Wayne was an awesome host who I've recommended to my friends and will more than likely use again on my next vacation to Harlem. thank you Wayne for opening your home and I apologize for writing my review 6 months after my visit.
20992	3820800	41351	5186614	Dr Gagan	Had a great time staying at Wayne's place. We were a bit apprehensive before we got there but Wayne took good care of us and we never encountered any problems during our stay there. We used to come back around 11 at night and the neighbourhood was quite safe. You need to open 4 doors all of which are locked to get in. So in that sense, it is quite safe. As for transportation, the 125th station is around  7-8 minutes away(walking distance) and it doesn't take long to get to tourist attractions like Times Square and Central Park. We had our own separate bathroom and it was very clean. Wayne provided us with the towels, bedsheets, coffee-machine, refrigerator, TV and much more. We didn't use the kitchen much as we were studying but you can use that too if you wish to cook. He even invited us over for dinner and I must say the food was yummy. For this price, I don't think you can get a better deal anywhere in NYC. Wayne, we just wanted to thank you for the wonderful experience we had and would definitely come back whenever we are in NY next. 
20992	3871872	41356	5364074	Claire	Great place.  Very private and great neighborhood.  Wayne was also very easy to deal with during the process.  Definitely recommend!
20992	4001090	41366	2936952	Wes & Gissel	We had a great stay with Wayne.  The room was just as described and it was comfortable, clean and safe.  Wayne had us settled in right away.  He even took the time to recommend some good eats around the neighborhood and suggested a few helpful apps for getting around the city on the subway and finding cool spots. We would definitely stay again!  
20992	4134233	41377	4856362	Tiago	My family experience in Harlem and New York were amazing, the apartment was more beautiful that it looks like in the photos. Wayne and his family let us feel extremely comfortable don't pushing or forcing anything. But They are always there when we needed some hint's of the city. The location is great between two avenues in the heart of Harlem you really can walk to Apollo Theater the most famous soul's food places and gospel churches. In 3 to 5 minutes you have access to the subway on 125th st. Such a nice experience I would certainly come back.A experiÃªncia da minha famÃ­lia no Harlem e em NYC foi muito legal. O apartamento Ã© mais bonito do que nas fotos o que foi uma boa surpresa. O Wayne e a sua famÃ­lia nos deixaram muito a vontade nÃ£o forÃ§ando a convivÃªncia quando estavamos cansados, mas quando precisamos de dicas do bairro ou da cidade estavam sempre disponÃ­veis para ajudar. O apartamento fica no coraÃ§Ã£o do Harlem podendo ir a pÃ© aos principais pontos do bairro como Teatro Apollo a Igreja Batista mais antiga dos EUA e os restaurantes turisticos como Silvia's, Red Rooster, e outros especializados na Soul Food. O Metro Ã© bem acessÃ­vel a pÃ© da pra chegar em uns 3 a 5 minutos, fÃ¡rmacias supermercado, mercadinho, fast food tudo perto tambÃ©m. Recomendo aos meus amigos como um bom local para ficar com Ã³timo custo-benefÃ­cio.
20992	4214471	41383	5550412	Juhani	Apartment/room was just great. Just like a normal hotel room, which in fact would cost 2-3 times more with location as good as this. Nice place, nice host, great holiday!
20992	4267299	41387	1992785	Alexander	It was my first airbnb experience and it was great! Wayne was friendly, easy-going, polite and helpful. I really enjoyed our conversations in the kitchen in the mornings. His cat Scooby was also very friendly. The room was clean, quet and spacious with a private bathroom. I felt myself there like at my own home.Location was convenient. It's Manhattan! There was subway express line few blocks away so I could get to the downtown quickly. If you are tired exploring Manhattan, just take express train and you are at home! There is good grocery on the way from subway station to apartment if you'd like to save money on restaurants.Many thanks to Wayne. I hope to stay here again. 
20992	4407759	41397	5838456	Sophia	Wayne was a wonderful host. The room was very clean and spacious, and the location was fantastic. Any question we had was answered immediately. We would definitely stay here again! 
20992	4662106	41413	5639294	Yohanna	Wayne est un hÃ´te trÃ¨s agrÃ©able, discret et serviable.La chambre est parfaite comparable Ã  une chambre d'hÃ´tel avec une salle de bain et un WC. La maison de Wayne est trÃ¨s bien agencÃ©e permettant ainsi de prÃ©server son intimitÃ©.Harlem est un quartier vivant et intÃ©ressant, loin des vieux clichÃ©s qu'on peut parfois entendre. La maison se situe juste Ã  cÃ´tÃ© d'une station de mÃ©tro, d'une Ã©picerie (bien pratique) et de trÃ¨s bons restaurants (le Sylvia's, adresse incontournable et le Red Rooster, trÃ¨s cÃ´toyÃ©).Nous avons passÃ© un trÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour.

20992	5505103	41458	4971449	Sara	We had a great stay at Wayne's place.Wayne is a great host, great assistance, great help and has a great place.We enjoyed that a lot.I'll for sure go back another time and stay at Wayne's place.
20992	5711497	41468	6459280	Tina	My Fiance and I stayed in the City Room - Private Luxury Suite.  It was in a convenient location about 10-15min subway ride from Midtown with trains arriving every 4minutes (during the day) (No.2 or 3 subway trains getting off at 125th Street).  Perfectly safe neighborhood with a couple of nice restaurants and plenty of take out if required. Wayne was an excellent host very friendly and helpful.  The room was very clean and had an air-conditioner which was fantastic in the summer heat. There was a private bar fridge and private ensuite with toilet and bath/shower all function well and clean. The common area had all you required, microwave, bbq, plates glasses etc, We would definately stay here again! 
20992	7092050	41523	6126480	Adrien	It was our first time with Airbnb and Wayne is a very good host ! The first night we have been received with a party. The room was great, the place is very nice and Harlem is a very great place. The subway is just near the appartment so it's very easy to go to visit Manhattan. If we could come back, we will go at Wayne's home again. You can choose Wayne's place without hesitation.
20992	7183070	41526	6883056	Erik	My stay at Wayne's City Room - Private Luxury Suite was great! Wayne met me outside the apartment (even after I was delayed getting in), and provided a very clear and helpful tour of the accommodations. He made clear who else was staying in the building as well as how and what in the kitchen was available for use. Great host, would definitely stay again! And its still very close to everything you might want to get to around midtown and very fairly priced.
20992	7391482	41535	7200271	Stephan	We had a great time at Wayne's place. The room had everything we needed. Wayne is a great host and he even took us to a college football game with him.We would go there again any time!
20992	7464794	41538	8520447	Paola	abbiamo trascorso i primi 2 giorni della luna di miele a casa di Wayne e siamo stati benissimo: zona tranquilla, casa accogliente e la nostra camera era pulita, spaziosa e arredata con gusto. Wayne Ã¨ un ottimo ospite, gentile e cordiale-
20992	7619702	41544	7198492	Ariane	A very nice host in a very nice place, comfortable, extremely clean and quiet.My brother, my sister and I shared the room a week, and it was large enough for all us to feel well.We particularly appreciated Harlem, really close to Central Park (we often took our breakfast there) and its lively atmosphere. Lots of place to discover there, to have dinner, to see a show... and a truly remarkable welcome !We totally recommended future travelers to New York to rest in Wayne's apartment to discover another side of New York's live.Enjoy !
20992	7705993	41547	4551753	Emile	Great room, very comfortable bed, clean. Location is good for a visit to NY, 10-15 min to times square on the Subway. Harlem Hospital just around the corner. If you are doing a course there... Would definately come back. 
20992	7982388	41558	8555359	Afanwi	Wayne was a great host! No complains. Even got me a Spare TV. Location is great. You are literally in the heart of cultural Harlem. Thanks Wayne!
20992	8595758	41585	4779190	Christian	"Waynes apartment is very cozy and welcoming. The room is just as described and looks exactly as in the pictures. We arrived very early and Wayne arranged for us to get the keys as soon as we arrived the apartment. We didn't see each other very much because we'd leave the house early in the morning and come back at night to sleep, but every time we crossed paths he was very nice with us. He even invited us to a dinner party on our last night in the apartment with the other people that was staying in the other room, and some others from another apartment, and we have so much fun, sharing stories and jokes with people from other countries. All in all there's only good thing that can be said about Wayne and his place. Also, the neighborhood, if you worry about the security, is very safe. Don't believe people who tell you ""Harlem is dangerous"", of course that doesn't mean that nothing can happen to you, but I mean that it is a very safe neighborhood in general. We arrived home at 1 AM one night, and even used the metro, and everything was fine. So, don't hesitate to rent this room. Best regards."
20992	8778545	41596	6908335	Flavia	The room is just perfect and it looks like in photos, it's clean and functional and the kitchen is very spacious and well furnished. The subway is a 5 minutes from the house and it's possible to arrive at Times Square in 10 minutes.The neighborhood is very quiet and characteristic. Wayne is the best home owner that you can meet: polite, kind, friendly and willing to help for anything. We have also partecipated in organized dinners with other guests of the rooms made available to him, it was very funny!! Certainly we will come back to Wayne in the next trip to Nyc. Wayne you are the best, see you soon! :)
20992	9071367	41612	1925059	Steven	I'll start by saying that this is a great value and that the host, Wayne, was very friendly and welcoming. The location in Harlem is what it is, you get the experience of Harlem at the cost of being a bit far away from downtown Manhattan. This isn't a big deal since the subways can get you there so fast anyway. The room was exactly as shown in the photos and was clean.I t was really great to have a private bath (not available for all rooms in the building). Things that could be improved: Our room was never cleaned nor the bathroom towels replaced while we were there (5 days), but that may have been our fault. Due to some health issues and reduced energy we tended to sleep late and only left the room near noon most days. There was a coffee machine and refrigerator (a rare find for a B&B) in the room, but no coffee for the coffee machine. Also, if there had been a microwave in the room rather than having to trek downstairs to the shared kitchen we could have  made better use of the refrigerator. We never did figure out the TV channels- a channel guide would have helped, but we weren't there to watch TV anyway. This sounds picky-I just wanted to paint the whole picture. It really comes down to expectations and I've seen better for less money (but not in NYC) and worse for more money at other B&B's. Overall you get great value for your money  here and if you spend some time with Wayne you'll have some great conversation.
20992	9200369	41621	8794025	Anita	Just returned from a week's stay here, and enjoyed every minute of it, from the friendly welcome from Wayne, to exploring the neighbourhood. The beds were comfortable, and having our own private bathroom was a bonus. The road is extremely quiet at night -no traffic noise. There is a garden out back if you need to smoke, and mostly everything you need in the kitchen. There is a large supermarket 5 mins walk away, and the nearest Metro (125 St) just 10 mins walk, the No2/3 Express train takes you downtown fast.. We had no worries walking home late at night. We can recommend Bill's Place for Jazz on Fri/Sat nights, and Sylvia's for Soul Food. We would definitely go back to stay with Wayne on our next trip. Much more fun than a boring hotel!
20992	11388781	41729	11573315	Thomas	Wayne offers a private room affordable room with a great location in Harlem. The place is clean and spacious. Wayne is respectful and easy to deal with.   
20992	11534710	41736	11796921	Maina	Nous avons passÃ© une semaine dÃ©but avril. La chambre est grande et correspond parfaitement Ã  la photo. La chambre donne sur le jardin, ce qui fait que ce n'est pas trop bruyant. La salle de bains est propre et la literie de bonne qualitÃ©. On est Ã  4 blocs du mÃ©tro et on rejoins Times Square en 10 minutes. Wayne est un hÃ´te trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et trÃ¨s serviable
20992	12235428	41756	11599798	Eleni	hi. This was our first experience with airbnb and we liked the way it works. We had a wonderful stay at Wayne s apartment. The room was large enough, very quiet, with lots of natural light.of course it needs to be refurbished a bit but we did not mind. Access to the subway was very easy, just less than 10 minutes away. Lots of storage in the room. Wayne is very nice, polite and helpful host. thank you
20992	13630050	41791	2619293	Florence	I had a great stay at Wayne's! The place is clean, comfortable, sunny and ideally located close to restaurants (a couple of steps away from legendary Sylvia's for instance) and the subway on 125 st. Wayne is a nice host, friendly and helpful.
20992	13792147	41794	6839869	Gail	Thanks for the hospitality, Wayne! The room was comfortable, and we loved the neighborhood. Red Rooster is a must for anyone who stays here - you're just 4 blocks away!
20992	13868384	41796	16328101	Tanveer	All good
20992	14082375	41801	14043297	Thibaud	Wayne est un hÃ´te extrÃªmement agrÃ©able et chaleureux, qui a su contribuer Ã  la qualitÃ© de notre sÃ©jour tout autant que la chambre en elle-mÃªme.La chambre est trÃ¨s bien placÃ©e et accueillante et permet de dÃ©couvrir la ville sans aucun problÃ¨me.
20992	15773998	41835	894828	Shanel	Great stay as always at Wayne's Place. Place was clean, sunny, peaceful & quiet. Always meet the best people through Wayne. I highly recommend staying here. 
20992	16246784	41844	14898569	Manuel	schÃ¶nes grosses Zimmer. War alles sehr sauber. Einzig das W-Lan hat teilweise nicht funktioniert
20992	17227275	41860	17454068	Carlos	My wife and I spent 9 days in the Private Luxury Suite and the experience was fantastic. What you see in the pictures is what you get, a very nice, quiet, clean, cozy and big room, with T.V, mini fridge, WI-FI, work desk and a private bathroom. We have our doubts at first in the location subject, but let me tell you, that Wayne's apartment is well located, yes, may be it is in Harlem, and because of that many people will think that are going to be far away from everything, but that's wrong! Subway is 4 blocks away, and it connects directly with midtown and lower Manhattan and all the highlights of the island like Central Park, Metropolitan Museum, Natural History Museum, Guggenheim Museum, Times Square, etc. In the 125th street of Harlem you will find several things that maybe will make your trip more comfortable like: Burger King, Mc Donalds, CVS, Marshalls, Old Navy, Children's Place, CarterÂ´s, Ralph Lauren, Dunkin Donuts, Gap, etc.  All this just 4 blocks away from the apartment, isn't that great?!, there are other great places to visit in the nearbyÂ´s, like the Red Rooster Restaurant, Social Corner and the famous Apollo Theater that offers all kind of great shows.About Wayne, We just have good things to say about him. He and his son, Malcolm make us feel like home. Thank you so much my friend, hope to see you soon and remember that in Merida you have your home.
20992	17742024	41868	13092614	Charlotte	Nous avons passÃ© une semaine chez Wayne du 9 au 16 aoÃ»t 2014, la chambre Ã©tait propre et spacieuse. Le quartier Ã©tait sympa, avec plein de restaurants et l'appartement est Ã  seulement 5-10 min Ã  pied du mÃ©tro. En arrivant la wifi ne fonctionnait pas ,nous en avons donc informÃ© Wayne et le lendemain tout Ã©tait rÃ©glÃ©.Pour conclure nous pouvons dire que nous avons passÃ© un trÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour et ceci Ã  un prix trÃ¨s raisonnable pour New York. We spent a week at Wayne's from August 9 to 16 2014, the room was clean and spacious. The neighborhood was nice, plenty of restaurants around and only 5 to 10 minutes walk from the subway. When we arrived the wifi wouldn't work so we told Wayne and everything was working again the next day.In the end we had a really good stay and at a really decent price for New York.
20992	18091194	41872	19933090	Peter	Wayne was great. For New York this is very reasonable. Great other folks staying there. Easy walk to CUNY. Neighborhood is New York but felt safe especially in Day. Description of room was very accurate. Very clean. 
20992	18828006	41883	7345595	Sandrine	Le soir de notre arrivÃ©e, Wayne avait organisÃ© une petite fÃªte, ce que j'ai trouvÃ© vraiment adorable et convivial pour nous accueillir.Mais aprÃ¨s une nuit dans l'avion sans avoir fermÃ© lâ??Å?il, nous n'avons malheureusement pas pu nous attarder, mais j'ai trouvÃ© l'attention trÃ¨s dÃ©licate.Nous sommes restÃ©es 9 nuits chez Wayne, arpentant des heures durant le quartier et NYC avec ma fille de 16 ans. Wayne sait parfaitement s'adapter aux attentes de chacun en terme d'autonomie ou d'Ã©change. Nous recherchions Ã  Ã©changer, partager avec nos hÃ´tes, dÃ©couvrir la culture de Harlem et pas rester dans une chambre dâ??hÃ´tel impersonnelle et nous avons Ã©tÃ© comblÃ©es! Bien sÃ»r, ce n'est pas en 8 jours qu'on peut bÃ¢tir une relation, d'autant que nous ne voulions pas non plus nous montrer trop intrusives, et lâ??embÃªter avec nos multiples questions, mais nous avons toutes les deux adorÃ© discuter et rire avec lui et son amie, Wayne Ã©tant trÃ¨s ouvert, cultivÃ© et drÃ´le. Il a Ã©tÃ© Ã  notre disposition pour chacune de nos questions et pour nous aider en cas de besoin, par exemple Ã  rÃ©server la navette pour l'aÃ©roport, mÃªme s'il Ã©tait sÃ»rement crevÃ© aprÃ¨s sa journÃ©e de travail.Nous avons Ã©tÃ© invitÃ©es Ã  partager leur petit dÃ©jeuner du dimanche matin, jour de notre dÃ©part, a le moment Ã©tait convivial et nous a Ã©normÃ©ment touchÃ©es.Wayne a attendu avec nous sur le trottoir l'arrivÃ©e du taxi pour une derniÃ¨re accolade et un bisou! La chambre Ã©tait (URL HIDDEN) de nombreux placards pour faciliter le rangement, d'un petit frigidaire pour stocker des aliments, d'un sÃ¨che cheveuxElle donne sur le jardin, trÃ¨s calme, on peut laisser les fenÃªtres ouvertes pour aÃ©rer car elles sont dotÃ©es de moustiquairesLe quartier est super proche des mÃ©tros, supermarchÃ©, restaus, musÃ©es... 2 stations de Times square, guÃ¨re plus du musÃ©um d'histoire naturelle et de central park, sur la ligne pour Coney IslandLe quartier est vivant, les voisins polis, avec plein d'adresses Ã  dÃ©couvrir, mais de toutes, la soirÃ©e Ã  l'Apollo reste un de mes meilleurs souvenirs, mixant magnifiquement rire et d'Ã©motion.Je recommande le kit complet : Wayne, l'appart et le quartier!
20992	19201693	41890	5976502	Flavia Peres	A estadia nessa acomodaÃ§Ã£o do Wayne foi Ã³tima. Quarto confortÃ¡vel, limpo e espaÃ§oso. Suite limpa e funcional, com banheira e chuveiros excelentes. A cozinha Ã© bastante funcional e espaÃ§osa, e o sistema geral de funcionamento da casa Ã© super tranquilo. A localizaÃ§Ã£o Ã© muito boa: somente 4 blocos pequenos atÃ© a parada do metrÃ´. HÃ¡ bares, restaurantes, farmÃ¡cia, supermercado, caixa atm, bancos, etc, tudo prÃ³ximo do local. Nos sentimos seguros na rua nas cercanias da propriedade a qualquer hora do dia ou da noite. O anfitriÃ£o e sua famÃ­lia (esposa e filho) sÃ£o super atenciosos, educados e fazem a gente se sentir Ã  vontade. Gostei muito!Recomendamos para todos - uma Ã³tima relaÃ§Ã£o custo/benefÃ­cio!Obrigado Wayne e Arlene! AtÃ© a prÃ³xima!  ;-)
20992	20084467	41905	17214236	Sabine	Wayne welcomed me very heartily and is a great host. The room is nearly like on the picture and itÂ´s clean and comfortable. On the first day Wayne made a wonderful american breakfast for his guests which I will miss.He always let someone feel welcome in his house and is open for questions and helpful. I enjoyed his porridge he made one day coming spontaneous in the kitchen. On the last day he called a cab for me so that I could leave Harlem just in time. I appreciate this experience and I canÂ´t wait to visitWayne again.  
20992	20314645	41909	983673	Priscilla	Easy contact with Wayne. The place is exactly as shown. Very clean, very spacious (especially for NYC standards) As mentioned below, this is a very safe neighborhood and extremely close to the subway line. Although I did not have much interact with Wayne (mostly because I was out and about all day) he did make me feel right at home and helped out any way he could. I would highly recommend this place to anyone. 
20992	22669609	41954	15961478	Laurence	I arrived about 8 pm and was welcomed by Wayne's colleague, met Wayne a couple of days later since he had been on vacation. Apartment v good and kitchen facilities good, with lots of cutlery and snacks in the fridge. Area v interesting being in mid Haarlem with high and low income well in evidence and a few v good and atmospheric restaurants to hand. V good transit to mid and downtown Manhattan. Wd return ! 
20992	27927438	42078	26637783	Frederic	Wayne nous a accueillis chaleureusement Ã  notre arrivÃ©e tardive le samedi soir.Nous nous sommes rapidement sentis comme chez nous.La chambre avec sa salle de bain privative situÃ©e Ã  l'Ã©tage est spacieuse, confortable et trÃ¨s calme (elle donne sur le jardin).Nous avons eu accÃ¨s Ã  une grande cuisine pendant tout le sÃ©jour.La maison est situÃ©e dans le sud d'Harlem, le quartier est tranquille (petites maisons), nous nous sommes sentis en sÃ©curitÃ©.Les mÃ©tro sont proches et permettent de se rendre dans le sud de Manhattan facilement.Nous avons passÃ© un excellent sÃ©jour chez Wayne.
20992	29318594	42100	21587517	MÃ³nica & Filipe	We were three and stayed at Wayneâ??s for 10 days. We had a very warm welcome by Wayne and his girlfriend. Wayne was kind to mount an extra bed. We had a nice stay at the Luxury Suite. He invited us to a party with other guests in the house, cool music, and the dinner that Wayne cooked for us was delicious. It was interesting to share experiences and stories. The Apartment is amazing, exactly as described. The room is very spacious and clean. It was an awesome experience to stay in Harlem, One can find many places to eat, especially Soul Restaurants. Two Subway stops: several lines to choose. One can go directly to JFK airport or Times Square. Weâ??re in love with NYC we want to come back and if possible to stay again at Wayneâ??s.
20992	30580881	42118	31272307	Richard	I booked the room for a colleague who was visiting from South Africa.  The room was just as described on the listing.  My colleague spoke extremely highly of his experience and had a wonderful time visiting New York City.  Thanks so much!!!
20992	31580270	42131	29254386	Catherine	Nous avons passÃ© un excellent sÃ©jour chez Wayne, hÃ´te trÃ¨s accueillant et disponible. Tout Ã©tait rÃ©uni pour passer de bonnes vacances, Harlem est trÃ¨s vivant et sÃ©curisant. Vraiment une location Ã  recommander aux couples et famille. 
20992	33583851	42154	30866566	Michelle	We had a wonderful stay at Wayne's for 6 nights, the room was exactly as per the photos - clean, spacious and quiet. It was our first time finding accommodation through Airbnb so we were slightly anxious about how it would pan out. However, Wayne was a great host, staying up for our late arrival to welcome us on our first night. Wayne is extremely easy going and always kept his apartment in a clean state. We were only a short walk to the nearest sub, which made daily commute easy and affordable. Whilst the street we stayed on was pleasant and quiet, the neighbourhood itself can seem a little rough at night, so try get home by 10:30pm would be our best advice. Overall, it was a good experience and we would highly recommend Wayne!
20992	34542436	42164	30007059	Josette	nous avons passÃ© un trÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour chez Wayne, qui est un hÃ´te trÃ¨s accueillant et disponible.Le logement correspond bien aux informations figurant sur la description. Il est trÃ¨s bien situÃ©, Ã  dix minutes du mÃ©tro.Nous n'hÃ©siterons pas Ã  rÃ©server le mÃªme logement si nous projetons un nouveau sÃ©jour Ã  New York.
20992	35722021	42176	25500384	Selina	Wayne was a very friendly and helpful host. We had a great time. The room was clean and very nice. Harlem is an interesting neighbourhood and you get easily to downtown. We would definitely stay there again.
20992	43153975	42233	1297305	Julia	Perfect stay, super beautiful spacious quiet (!) room, very reliable, friendly, helpful host (thank you Wayne), we can highly recommand a stay at Wayne's in Harlem, we so loved it. Awesome neighborhood, beautiful crowds, wide variety of the most delicious foods, great opportunities to jogg (Central Park, Morningside Park and St Nicholas Park!!) and easy and prompt connections to anywhere in the City. Wayne cooks breakfast for everybody every Saturday morning. Epic and super convivial. Go!
20992	46069886	42254	1231461	Jeffrey	Wayne is the best!  His private luxury sweet is very large with your own private bathroom; a huge plus.  And the entrance is about as private as you can get. He love's people and his beautiful home is full of world travelers; and it is not uncommon for him to invite you to join in on his social activities.  The neighborhood can't be beat in NYC. Love me some Harlem....restaurants and coffee shops galore; jazz clubs; the 2/3 subway is right there.  Highly recommended!!! You're going to love it. 
20992	48979969	42277	17214236	Sabine	Ich bin das zweite mal zu Gast bei Wayne und habe mich wieder einmal zuhause gefÃ¼hlt. Zudem kam ich wieder in den Genuss einesgemeinsamen FrÃ¼hstÃ¼cks mit allen GÃ¤sten von Wayne. Auch wenn immer wenig Zeit bleibt, so geniesse ich dieses in der gemÃ¼tlichen KÃ¼che unten. Die Nachbarschaft ist freundlich und die typischen Brownstone Houses charakteristisch fÃ¼r Harlem. Das Zimmer war wie gewohnt sehr sauber und komfortabel. Wayne ist ein unkomplizierter, hilfsbereiter Gastgeber und so Gott will freue ich mich nÃ¤chstes Jahr auf einen weiteren Besuch :)
20992	49294729	42279	21381272	Gabrielle	My stay was nice. I was barely there, but loved the neighborhood. It was a bit warm in the room, the air con was far from bed and I don't like to sweat at night. Definitely recommend this place. 
20992	49653487	42282	21741537	Samuel	My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Wayne. He was very welcoming, helpful, and hospitable. His home was accurately described, very clean, and exactly what you see in the pictures. Saturday morning breakfast prepared by Wayne was such a treat, he really goes the extra mile. There were also many great soul food restaurant options near by that we frequent during our stay within walking distance as well as markets. Waynes place is located in the perfect location and the neighborhood was quiet and seemed very safe. It was the most ideal experience for an airbnb experience. If we ever need a place to stay in NYC we will certainly book Waynes place again. We 100% recommend you book your stay in NYC at Waynes for sure, you will not be disappointed!
20992	50382195	42288	3202694	Tarun	Wayne is a great host and a big hearted fun person! The room is fairly large by NY standards and though a bit bare, its well worth the money!
20992	51512904	42297	201116	Debo	My daughter and I had a lovely and relaxing visit at Wayne's spacious, wood lined home. The room had glorious high ceilings and hard wood floors. The first night was a bit chilly because of the grand windows. We came in late and tired, Wayne had asked if it was warm enough. By the time we got into bed it was a bit chilly and I was too tired to say wake him up.However, the next day we told him and it was nice and toasty in the room. Having a room en suite is a luxury in itself and we really dug the space. Wayne had invited us out to  a Jazz club around the corner, since my daughter and I are both Jazz singers. We went to  The Shrine and danced to a great dj and a nice mix of folks.The area has everything you need and is very close to the metro. The street is charming as is the host. We had a great time and would have loved to stay longer. Definitely highly recommend the host and his spacious woodened brick castle in the heart of Harlem.
20992	52222400	42304	6444718	Nedjoi	La chambre est conforme aux photos... propre, spacieuse et confortable tout comme le reste de la maison. La cuisine est trÃ¨s bien Ã©quipÃ©e, on a l'impression d'Ãªtre chez soi.La maison est trÃ¨s bien placÃ©e, 5 min du mÃ©tro et 10/15 minutes de time square. Nous avons beaucoup aimÃ© le quartier, calme et authentique.Wayne est un hÃ´te trÃ¨s accueillant, trÃ¨s agrÃ©able, disponible  tout en restant discret. Bravo Wayne pour le super petit dÃ©jeuner du samedi matin !!!C'Ã©tait notre deuxiÃ¨me sÃ©jour chez Wayne et Ã©videmment nous retournerons chez lui lors de notre prochain sÃ©jour Ã  New York. Je recommande donc sans hÃ©sitation ce logement. Inutile de chercher ailleurs!!! 
20992	52990387	42311	45645871	Arijit	It was our first experience of airbnb and Wayne's place was a fabulous initiation. Warm and friendly, we made friends and a truckload of great memories
20992	54989235	42335	45723312	Elpida	Our host was a very gentle man . We arrived late at night and we waited to welcome us . the neighborhood was relatively peacefull and easily accessible to the metro .Every Saturday is preparing lunch for customers and this is very kind of him. not at all bothersome in that they related to our stay .Thank you very much and we recommend others to choose apartments
20992	55473213	42339	7580141	Martin	This was my first Airb B&B experience and it was nothing short of excellent. In addition to providing a clean, safe space Wayne went above and beyond as a host and ensured that our expectations were exceeded. It was very obvious that the treatment we received was not out of the ordinary as the guests that were in the home were also very pleased...We will DEFINITELY be using him the next time we are in Harlem. In a way, I am ap worried that another host won't be able to measure up!Thanks Wayne!!
20992	55947954	42345	49115836	Javier	As soon as we arrived in New York, Wayne contacted us giving us the best way to travel to his location and offered assistance if we needed it. When we arrived, Wayne gave us a tour of the home and everything that was available for our use. Everything was extremely clean and organized and a great quiet neighborhood. The commute to downtown was a short subway ride and everything was conveniently around us. We were mainly there at night, but Wayne and his girlfriend invited us to breakfast Saturday morning meeting and chatting with the other travellers in his home. I will definitely be contacting him if I ever travel to New York again.
20992	56229406	42348	894828	Shanel	I always stay at Wayne's Places when I am in NYC. And I ALWAYS have a perfect experience. His place is clean, and had everything I needed. Always greeted with love. He's created really great spaces for people! I'd definitely recommend you to stay here! (In any of the rooms or apartments. I've stayed in several. They are all a good place to find peace in NYC. 
20992	57375588	42363	47698692	Tiffaine	L'accueil chez Wayne, c'est tres bien passÃ©, il nous avait prealablement bien expliquÃ© comment se rendre chez lui. La chambre correspondait parfaitement a la description et nous avons meme pu partager un petit dejeuner americain avec son autre hote et sa copine et lui le samedi matin. Il nous a fait nous sentir a l'aise chez lui comme chez nous. De plus, sa cuisine est parfaite si l'on souhaite effectuer des repas tranquillement a la maison dans la semaine et faire ainsi quelques economies. Voyage au top dans la ville de NY et cela en petite partie grace  a Wayne. :)
20992	64186771	42429	60207115	Wesley	The host was extremely accommodating. Very personable. Would be happy to rent from Wayne again. The room was extremely clean and comfortable.  The location was only a few minutes drive to central park also, great location. Will absolutely be renting this property again. 
20992	68423915	42464	59399904	LÃ­a	La experiencia fue excelente. La habitaciÃ³n es tal cual se muestra en las fotos: espaciosa, luminosa, cÃ³moda y limpia. La atenciÃ³n de Wayne y su gente fue increÃ­ble! Pasamos unos dÃ­as maravillosos. El barrio es super tranquilo. Hubo dÃ­as en los que volvÃ­amos muy tarde, en subte y todo muy bien, sin problemas. Sin dudas volverÃ­a a ir!
20992	70418694	42477	29744023	Sven	It was everything as nice as on the pictures. Wayne is a very friendly host and the neighborhood of East Harlem is really interesting, in a positive way, with a lot of original bars and stores and a good subway connection. And its save. We walked there at night with a 6 years old girld and we felt never unsave. My familiy and me, we enjoyed our stay.
20992	71435120	42485	4870278	Joris	Wayne was de ideale host, zeer behulpzaam en vriendelijk. De kamer is groter dan ie lijkt op de foto en er zit zelfs een eigen badkamer bij. Zelfs met open raam is er weinig geluid van verkeer buiten.  Gemeenschappelijk keuken is ook clean en gezellig. Buurtje (Harlem) is heerlijk, op de hoek van de straat zit een soul food buffet waar je al vanaf 10 uur 's ochtends helemaal los kunt gaan.  Metro lijn 2/3 is 5-7 minuten lopen.
20992	74326561	42504	68229845	Lore	Wayne es muy amable, nos ayudo con todo lo que necesitamos, la habitacion es tal cual se muestra en las fotos, limpia y muy espaciosa, la cama muy comoda. el sabado nos juntamos todos para desayunar y fue una muy buena experiencia. es perfecto para conocer nueva york, cerca del metro caminando. y zona segura aun volviendo muy tarde. gracias por todo wayne!
20992	78164051	42526	32346409	Valerio	Wayne Ã¨ fantastico!!! Abbiamo passato 10 notti in questa bellissima camera, veramente enorme sui 25 metri quadrati + il bagno interno e due guardaroba a muro!!! Perfetta!!! La stanza con due luminose finestre affaccia sui giardini interni delle palazzine stile inglese tutto verde non sembra neanche di essere al centro di New  York infatti i rumori delle strade sono inesistenti. Letto molto grande  e comodissimo dopo giornate piene di chilometri. La linea metro 2-3,la piÃ¹ vicina Ã¨ a 5 minuti a piedi ed Ã¨ tra le migliori linee per muoversi a New York. La zona Ã¨ molto caratteristica e tranquilla, tornavamo anche alle 02 di notte senza nessun problema. Vacanza meravigliosa grazie Wayne!!!!Una piccola pecca la wifi ogni tanto era un po' troppo lenta
20992	78661950	42529	8694332	Frances	I was looking for an Airbnb for a friend who was awaiting back surgery.  As you can imagine it's scary looking at the ads and wondering which will work. Well, Wayne went out of his way to accommodate and support my friend. Everything was just as described, but Wayne himself was even better!
20992	81351988	42543	43669851	Emilio Vicente	Teniamos plena libertad y todo a nuestra disposiciÃ³n, y tambien compartimos algunos ratos de charla con el anfitriÃ³n incluso con otras personas que se encontraban alojadas. 
20992	87260467	42570	71341326	Laurent	Wayne a Ã©tÃ© un hÃ´te charmant, accueillant, chaleureux et disponible. Le seul petit bÃ©mol Ã©tait qu'il n'a pu Ãªtre prÃ©sent Ã  notre arrivÃ©e car je n'ai pu le joindre sur mon tÃ©lÃ©phone qui ne marchait pas lÃ  bas. Heureusement, un autre locataire Ã©tait lÃ  et nous a ouvert. C'est seulement en fin de journÃ©e que nous avons pu rencontrer notre hÃ´te qui a prÃ©parÃ© notre chambre Ã  ce moment lÃ . Donc, un sentiment mitigÃ© Ã  l'arrivÃ©e qui a Ã©tÃ© complÃ¨tement oubliÃ© par la suite, car Wayne est une personne trÃ¨s disponible qui a un contact approfondi avec ses locataires et il organise le samedi matin un brunch collectif, ce qui est trÃ¨s sympathique. Pour le reste, rien Ã  dire, chambre et salle de bains correcte, propre et fonctionnelle. Le living room et la cuisine collective sont parfaites. Et finalement, Ã  part l'arrivÃ©e, notre sÃ©jour a Ã©tÃ© parfait et le quartier, qui n'est pas visuellement un des plus plaisants de Manhattan, est pourtant trÃ¨s vivant et sÃ»r et trÃ¨s intÃ©ressant pour son cotÃ© communautaire. La rue du logement est par ailleurs calme et sympathique.
20992	92470379	42590	23010523	Rebecca	Traveled to New York for the first time with my best friend for our birthdays. the day we arrived, we were told as we were arriving at the airport that the room we had requested was going to still be rented out to the people who were already there. the host said he upgraded us to our own little apartment two stories above. we were excited, but I don't think the apartment was ready for vacancy .The apartment was nice, but the basic amenities fell short. the towels did not smell so fresh, and there were no napkins, paper towels , hand soap or dish soap in sight. there was only one bath towel and wash rag that my friend and I had to share. I contacted the host to see if he could get us some hand soap and more bath towels on the second day. he finally brought one extra towel , about five napkins ,and a almost fully used bottle of some soap I've never heard of, later that evening . my friend and I ended up going out and buying soap and other amenities . it was just a real inconvenience. the area we stayed in was okay. there is a group of people that hang out till about 4 in the morning right across the street. they were pretty loud, but thank God the AC was also pretty loud. I don't know if this day would have been different if we were put into the room in his home that we originally purchased. The third story apartment was especially hard to carry all of our luggage into. three narrow flights of stairs and two women who are not that physically strong. I did appreciate the area that we stayed in because it gave us an idea of what living there is like. we got to see the culture of it all, and that was memorable. I read a lot of reviews before I signed up to stay, and it seemed that everybody said that it was easy to get ahold of the host , I found that to be the exact opposite. he didn't reply very promptly to requests nor did he really give us any direction or insight. I am just being honest because I would want to know if I was traveling out of my element as well. I almost felt like I should have paid a little bit more money and got a hotel where I would have had fresh clean sheets , soap , fresh towels, prompt service and direction . This is in no way to slender Wayne. The guy seems like a cool dude, and he invited us to breakfast on Sunday morning but we were sleeping and weren't able to make it. I'm just giving my honest feedback because Airbnb requests us to review our stay so they can improve the experience. the subway station was about 2 blocks down. It was convenient to catch the subway from...
20992	93821265	42596	67815238	æ?¶ç?¨	It is big and comfortable. Wayne is a very nice person. He invited us for breakfast that made us feel being home.
20992	96603525	42605	75803771	Rachel	Lovely room had a very comfortable stay !! Close to train station which was great when travelling late from city. Liked the area, Wayne was a great host and very accommodating. 
20992	99668535	42618	90117128	Johanna	We had a great time at Wayne's place! Even tough we just talked to him for a couple minutes during our stay he was really nice and made our stay really good! There were other airbnb guests staying at his appartment too, so it was great meeting them in the shared kitchen and talking to them! The subway is just a few blocks away and easy to get to! It was my first experience with airbnb and I absolutly enjoyed it! 
20992	102425451	42631	20983597	Melissa	"Le sÃ©jour chez Wayne Ã©tait trÃ¨s agrÃ©able. Le jour suivant notre arrivÃ©e, Wayne a organisÃ© un dÃ©jeuner avec les autres hÃ´tes, ce qui nous a permis d'avoir les retours des autres personnes sur NY, ainsi que les ""bons plans"". Wayne Ã©tait disponible pour toutes questions sur la ville.Le logement est situÃ© Ã  proximitÃ© de plusieurs differentes lignes de mÃ©tro, ce qui est trÃ¨s pratique. La chambre est calme, les fenÃªtres donnent sur les jardins."
20992	106864236	42651	36887828	Sharon	Wayne is very thoughtful and funny! The room is nice and the neighborhood is cool.
20992	108175967	42657	19018172	John	Attention to detail not good. Only one towel and one thin blanket initially provided. Eventually rectified after I asked twice.Tall window in bedroom had inadequate curtain, which compromised privacy from nearby apartments.
20992	110174683	42667	63889292	Conrad	Wayne was friendly and charming throughout our stay. He offered nice suggestions on dining and activities. His directions to convenient transportation were simple and helpful. The building is comfortable and clean. I would definitely stay there again. 
20992	111914964	42676	31087946	M.	Bon nombre de personnes nous avaient dÃ©conseillÃ© Airbnb Ã  New York, oÃ¹ le risque d'annulation des hÃ´tes Ã  la derniÃ¨re minute est, semble-t-il, plus important qu'ailleurs (nous en avions Ã©tÃ© victimes pour notre part Ã  Amsterdam). Avant mÃªme de rÃ©server, nous avons contactÃ© Wayne pour lui faire part de cette crainte (nous avions prÃ©vu de venir Ã  NY avec notre bÃ©bÃ© de 10 mois...). Wayne (et les nombreux commentaires le concernant) nous ont rassurÃ©.Que dire de notre hÃ´te, si ce n'est que pendant notre sÃ©jour, Wayne a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s accueillant et Ã  l'Ã©coute de nos besoins. Il a mÃªme aidÃ© un couple d'amis vivant Ã  MontrÃ©al, qui nous a rejoint pour une nuit Ã  New York, Ã  trouver un logement Ã  la derniÃ¨re minute et a fini par leur mettre Ã  disposition son propre appartement !La gentillesse de Wayne est sans limite. Nous nous sommes rendus compte Ã  l'aÃ©roport, au retour, que nous avions oubliÃ© un sac dans la maison de Wayne et l'avons aussitÃ´t contactÃ©. Wayne nous a gentiment proposÃ© de nous l'envoyer Ã  PARIS...Notre hÃ´te a grandement contribuÃ© Ã  faire de notre semaine Ã  New York un sÃ©jour mÃ©morable. Harlem, dans lequel est situÃ©e la maison de Wayne, est un quartier trÃ¨s vivant. De trÃ¨s bons cafÃ©s et restaurants aux alentours (mention spÃ©ciale pour le restaurant japonais traditionnel situÃ© Ã  l'angle de la 125Ã¨me et du Malcolm X Boulevard!). Times Square est par ailleurs Ã  une dizaine de minutes en mÃ©tro avec la ligne expresse.Nous ne pouvons que conseiller de sÃ©journer chez Wayne et y retournerons avec plaisir.
20992	113693841	42687	6074953	Tara	 Wayne was a wonderful host who went out of his way to make me feel welcome in his home. Although my stay was cut short (through no fault of his), he was easily accessible, and answered every question I had. I highly recommend him and his listings to anyone looking!
20992	116371850	42703	69663132	Gerard	Wayne est un hÃ´te trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et charmant, n'hÃ©sitant pas Ã  conseiller, Ã  prÃ©parer et partager un brunch ou un verre Ã  la nuit tombÃ©e malgrÃ© sa journÃ©e de travail.L'appartement est trÃ¨s bien situÃ©, Ã  proximitÃ© immÃ©diate d'Ã©piceries, du mÃ©tro (ligne directe pour Midtown et Brooklyn, un changement pour Liberty Statue...) et de restaurants (Pizzeria excellente, soul food, chinois, japonais, etc...sur place ou Ã  emporter et dÃ©guster dans la cuisine mise Ã  disposition)Un dÃ©tail cependant, la tempÃ©rature de la chambre Ã©tait plutÃ´t fraÃ®che (novembre) malgrÃ© le chauffage, mais nous vivons depuis plus de 20 ans aux Antilles, ceci expliquant peur-Ãªtre cela.Nous conseillons trÃ¨s vivement cet appartement trÃ¨s calme avec salle de bain privÃ©e, et y reviendrions trÃ¨s certainement lors d'un autre sÃ©jour Ã  NYC.Chantal et Gerard

20992	123115952	42731	26756817	Loreto	The room is really quite, spacious and comfortable.The area is very safe and convenient to visit anywhere in Manhattan, the  metro  express line is in a few minutes and Wayne is very friendly making you feel like at home.    
20992	125028184	42738	26064088	AurÃ©lie	"Nous avons passÃ© une semaine dans le logement de Wayne, dÃ©crit comme ""private luxury suite"", mais nous avons Ã©tÃ© assez dÃ©Ã§ues par les prestations, notamment l'accueil, la communication pendant le sÃ©jour, la propretÃ© et l'Ã©tat gÃ©nÃ©ral de la chambre et des parties communes. Le logement est assez proche du mÃ©tro et permet d'accÃ©der facilement Ã  Manhattan, mais nous ne nous sentions pas toujours en sÃ©curitÃ©, notamment le soir."
20992	133595040	42789	35385457	Burcu	We had a lot of privacy and Wayne was very helpful and respectful host. The place is in great location, we were at modern art museum in 20 mins with bus.  I think it's a great deal when you think the price, location and if privacy is important for your trip.
20992	136894358	42806	119737133	Mj	Lovely accommodations in a great area of Harlem. Wayne was a gracious host, and you will love the proximity of this location to all of the best shops, restaurants and local hang outs that Harlem has to offer. Also super close to the 2 & 3 trains. I was pleasantly surprised by how roomy and private the space was. Wi-fi was an added bonus. It really felt like a home away from home. Would definitely stay again :)
17272	17859146	41869	8440822	Helen	Sedika was an amazing host.  She was very responsive and gave us lots of recommendations to help us plan our trip.  We had awkward arrival and departure times and she worked with us to do the key transfers with ease.  Her apartment was exactly as portrayed and very clean.  The location was just perfect - walking distance to transit and tons of great shops, restaurants, bars, weekend markets and the gorgeous campus of the Pratt Institute where you can check out outdoor art installations.We would definitely come back!
17272	21566472	41931	3482342	Gary	My wife and I were in Ft. Greene to visit our new grandchild.  Sedika's apartment was in a great location next to the park and very near lots of shops, restaurants and bars while still being in a quiet neighborhood.  The apartment itself was spacious, clean and we were able to park our car on the street right by the apartment.  We were met by a friend of Sedika's because of her absence  from the country.  He was courteous and helpful.  Just one advisory, the unit is a five floor walkup so if you have any health issues with climbing stairs, this might not be your place.  Otherwise, it suited the bill nicely.
17272	22143329	41943	4674059	Tiberio	Purtroppo, all'ultimo momento, ho dovuto rinunciare al viaggio. Ma Sedika Ã¨ sempre stata disponibile ad ogni mia richiesta: scrivevo messaggi tramite e lei rispondeva sempre e in tempi davvero rapidi. Conoscevo giÃ  quella zona di Brooklyn. Ã? bellissima e comodissima anche per arrivare a Manhattan. Grazie Sedika
17272	22438407	41949	5672363	Mo	Sedika's apartment was cozy and perfectly located in the heart of beautiful Fort Greene. I loved staying here! Make sure you take the time to browse some of Sedika's books and films about Afghanistan. She has a great collection.
17272	22805467	41958	1286874	May	Sedika was a great host - a few issues but she was quick to rectify and very responsive throughout my stay.The apartment is exactly as pictured: comfortable and has everything you could need. Best thing is its wonderful location. Close to a good range of subway lines, lots of restaurants/cafes/bars. Beautiful brownstone-lined street. Was very sad to leave and would definitely stay again!
17272	33340480	42150	32413710	Benjamin	Sedika made sure everything would be flawless and was very communicative. Keys, facilities, checking out, everything was very simple to sort out. The apartment is the most gorgeous alcove of tranquility, very thoughtfully decorated and equipped, extremely clean, with the most beautiful morning light. The neighborhood is amazing, Fort Greene Park down the street, all sorts of cafes, delis and restaurants around in a clean and fun area. 
17272	34238277	42161	24019063	Amos	Sedika was a great host, although I did not meet her in person. She was helpful in working through a problem with airbnb that was not allowing me too book. She also was accommodating to my arrival, and arranged for me to pick up the apartment keys from a neighbor. She was quick to respond to any of my questions. She also emailed me a list she made of places she suggests. She pointed me to the farmers market at Ft. Greene, and I loved it. Again, great host!Her place was exactly as described. It was clean, quiet, and comfortable. I hope all of my future airbnb bookings are as good as with Sedika.The neighborhood is nice. The street is pretty quiet, and safe. The apartment is also close to many restaurants, coffee shops, Ft. Greene, and the subway. I rode the subway from JFK, and it took about an hour. Getting to Manhattan was quick and easy!
17272	39821907	42211	21726142	Helena	It was great to stay with Sedika, she's very well organised and her place is so conveniently located the park and Fort Greene. Her place is clean and very relaxing. 
17272	41670975	42224	21726142	Helena	The place was great. Much better than a hotel room. Close to UrbanGlass, where I was teaching for the week. Nice neighborhood. Walk to anything. The only (non) issue was the 4 flight walk up!
17272	44339011	42241	39760299	Karla	The Lovely Studio near Ft Green was exactly as advertised: a lovely studio. The apartment host had everything organized perfectly: keys, information about neighborhood restaurants and even oranges and chocolate in the fridge. The neighborhood was lively and safe with plenty of on-street parking. I could not ask for a more peaceful yet vibrant and energizing stay.
17272	61144205	42400	42562556	Dirk	The host canceled this reservation 70 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
17272	61144207	42400	4740665	Darren	The host canceled this reservation 93 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
17272	68134230	42462	9702428	Amaryllis	A really nice flat in a lovely area. Very well located close to the station in a quiet and safe street next to the park and  by Dekalp Avenue where there is a variety of cosy cafes and restaurants. Very easy access to Manhattan and JFK. It is 4 floors up the stairs which is not the most convenient when it comes to caring the luggage but apart from that the flat has very good size and is quiet, cosy, warm,  with a great morning light. Sedika has been very accommodating and helpful.Very pleased with Sedikaâ??s place and location, added to our great NY experience. Looking forward to coming back! 
17272	69651406	42472	1802305	Meike	I had a wonderful stay at SedikaÂ´s apartment. It is very cozy and bright with a beautiful morning light and a comfortable bed. It is located on a quiet and safe street, very close to the park, shops, restaurants and subway. Getting to Manhattan ist easy and fast. Everything was well organized and the communication with Sedika was great. Would definitely love to stay here again !
17272	90203878	42582	52466344	Darian	There was an issue with the cleanliness of the apartment upon arrival, but Sedika was quick and responsive to the problem. She was hospitable and as accommodating as she could be throughout my stay. The apartment is close to everything. Definitely a great location to be in! 
17272	93333346	42594	236043	Catherine	Sedika waited for us until 10 pm, and welcomed us with cold water, all of which were appreciated since we arrived in the middle of a heat wave.The A/C unit works well, except that a weird smell comes from it. It wasn't that bad, though. The appartment itself was spacious and comfortable. The area is great - nice parks, restaurants, cafÃ©s, and shops are all within walking distance, and proximity to multiple subway lines is really convenient if you are visiting different areas in NYC. Overall, a really nice place to come back to at the end of a big day :) Thanks Sedika! 
17272	99169153	42616	640310	Martin	Sedika's HOME is well located, equipped, comfortable and clean! We feel really like at home! Great attention to details and a very functional place.We stayed for 2 weeks and would definitely recommend and already plan to stay back at her place next trip.
17272	103830450	42637	19581762	Alessandro	Ottima esperienza, appartamento molto pulito e ordinato, la location Ã¨ molto carina, ha il vantaggio di essere in una zona tranquilla, ma vivace , poco lontano da manhattan (20/30 minuti circa per arrivare a midtown in metro) e vicina a tanti bei localini e quartieri interessanti di brooklyn.Non abbiamo potuto conoscere personalmente Sedika che era fuori per lavoro che perÃ² Ã¨ stata molto disponibile e ci ha fornito preziosi consigli; abbiamo perÃ² conosciuto la sorella e il fidanzato molto simpatici e disponibili che ci hanno accolti e coi quali abbiamo bevuto una birra sul tetto. (scoprendo questa parte dell'appartamento a noi sconosciuta, ma fantastica).In generale un'ottima esperienza da ripetere e che va oltre i vecchi stereotipi legati a brooklyn.
17272	105649022	42645	1366352	Oliver	Sedika's place is really a great find.  It's actually even more warm and comfortable than the photos suggest (if you can believe it).  The apartment is on a beautiful and tranquil tree-lined historic block just a stones throw from Ft. Greene park.  The location is fantastic because nearly every subway passes within a few blocks radius -- getting to Manhattan or anywhere else in NYC is a breeze if you feel the need leave this great neighborhood.  Sedika was out of town when I arrived but her friendly sister met me with the keys and was very accommodating with some last minute changes I had to make to my arrival time and Sedika was in contact with me and checking in regularly before and during my stay to make sure everything was going smoothly.All in all it is a great place that I would try to book again in the future if available.
17272	110492359	42669	41142302	Stefanie	Sedika was a great host! The apartement is absolutely lovely and clean looking exactly as on the picture. The location is safe and within walking distance to the next subway station. Manhattan is just a 20min subway ride away.We really enjoyed staying in Brooklyn since the atmosphere is less stressfull than in Manhattan and also because there were so many nice cafÃ©s and bars around.
17272	110955747	42672	6589250	Dmitri	The stay was great and Sedika did everything to make it so. She went beyond what is posted in the listing to make our experience as comfortable as possible.
17272	113746431	42687	7960122	Sylvan	Sedika, was extremely communicative and helped with a slightly out-of-the-ordinary arrival request. Her apartment had everything I needed and was tastefully decorated - even a little on the minimal side which is my preference! Her place is in the center of Fort Greene, close to almost every subway line, Fort Greene park, and numerous good coffee shops, restaurants, bars, and the BAM cinema/theater. I knew the area because I'm a former Brooklynite so it was easy to slip back into Brooklyn life. Also she's right near the excellent Greenlight books. 
17272	114580568	42693	5431978	Lady	Sedika is an incredibly sweet person. Great communicator and incredibly accommodating since I had unusual check in and check out times.  Her place is very clean and full of light.
17272	116658431	42706	3210035	Evelina	I truly recommend this! Very nice apartment with a lovely morning sun shining in. Also a very friendly and helpful host. Top rating!
17272	124997761	42738	98258410	Shane	Sedika is a really nice host, helped us everything we need even she was not there. The location is closed to transit and shopping/restaurants area. We had a great time staying at her place. 
17272	134488704	42793	33644038	Numamitsu	 Sedika is really kind and she helped me to bring up my heavy suitcases. The appartment was cozy and clean. The location is very convinient and so close from Park. I love the neigborhood. When I come back to NY, I would like to stay at her place again!
24598	88971841	42577	7954069	Magdalena	Laurent's apartment was the perfect place for my friend and I to spend a weekend in NYC. It was very clean with enough room for us and all our belongings. Very easy to get to from JFK and the neighborhood was great with lots of fun bars, restaurants, and easy access to other nearby neighborhoods as well. Laurent was very accommodating in letting us stay an extra night which we really appreciated. His place has everything you need for a great time in the city and I would highly recommend checking it out!
24598	91870941	42589	4194459	Rozena	Apt was very clean! Laurent was helpful and communicative at all times!
24598	95649699	42602	17777137	Tess	Laurent was great with check-in. He was very welcoming and helped me to carry my luggage up the steps. The apartment was a bit hot during my stay but the fan helped. The apartment has a nice sized kitchen and living area.
24598	99661371	42618	48649813	Guilherme	We had a good stay at Laurent's apartment. It's well localized and communication was great.
24598	107456468	42653	52875199	Eleanor	The host canceled this reservation 13 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
24598	115683085	42700	24938693	Emily	Laurent was very helpful with getting into the place. Since he was out of town he sent us a ton of pictures describing where to find the key. The place was clean and had everything we needed. We never felt unsafe. Nice neighborhood. We did a lot of walking since the location was so good. Would stay here again!
24598	140217479	42822	9827434	Jesper	This was a cool place! Close to everything. Lot's of good restaurants, diners, bars etc. Close to many sights.Laurent? So easy to communicate with, always getting back quick and helped with the questions, that I had.Simple question - woud I stay here again, next time in NY? YES
7765	110344989	42668	16728795	Dang	Alexis is awesome - very polite and helpful. Room is comfortable and conveniently located
15331	114455035	42692	16020279	Greg	We had a lovely stay in Myko's apartment, it's just as the pictures. The apartment was very beautiful and nicely designed, the bedroom was comfy, the bathroom area was very clean and the kitchen well equipped. Most important to us it was in a very well situated area with tourist attractions close by. The host provided contact as needed before arrival and was friendly with helpful tips during our stay. We will definitely come back. Thank you for hosting us.
15331	115721022	42700	91647409	Pamela	This is a great apartment, with a wonderful host. You can't beat Downtown for easy access to the whole city. A five-star option for visitors!
15331	120735948	42715	1362027	Elizabeth	This is a shared apartment but we rarely were aware of our host's presence.  It was very quiet, private, and comfortable.  And it is a bargain!!!!!
15331	121490953	42721	21707788	James	Location, Location, Location!!! Great value, not flashy. Building has a ton of amenities 
15331	123275037	42732	11385783	August	My first time using Airbnb and visiting NYC was amazing, which was all owing to staying at Myko's apartment! The apartment itself is perfect, located on Wall Street with many restaurants and tourist attractions near by, convenient transportation to Manhattan and the whole city. It is comfortable and very clean, you can also work out in the gym and have breakfast at lounge. What's more important is Myko is such a kindhearted person, you can always ask him for help. I'm so glad to meet people and make friends when I stayed at this apartment. And even don't want to leave when I have to. I totally recommend this apartment to all of you!
15331	124697204	42737	64062160	Melissa	What can I say about Myko and his place. Well its my best Airbnb experience ever. The location is amazing, the building is so luxury and the apartment is clean and beautiful. But above that Myko is the best host. I was not expecting to find a friend. He was so nice with us and so welcoming. I really felt like we were family and I felt like home for couples days. I already miss him and Wall Street. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND Myko as host... ;) 
15331	127722961	42755	17818046	Daniel	I had an awesome time at Myko's place! I had to book on rather short notice but he immediately responded and happily complied with me arriving earlier than I initially stated. He was very welcoming and cordial and offered great tips about where to get food or go out at night. The accommodation itself is impeccable. The bed was big and comfy and the building offers a lot of extras like a gym at the top floor which I happily used. The location is ideal in the heart of NYC's financial district and within 3 minutes by feet of the subway. This was definitely my best airbnb experience and I have made a great friend! Will definitely come back!
15331	128932492	42763	41484669	Anand	Place was great for my needs. Used the gym, hangout at the lounge, and host was very friendly and checked in on me to see how I was doing. 
15331	129402385	42765	69371099	William	Great place to stay - convenient, clean and friendly host! 
15331	130083791	42770	21910384	Sven	Myko is such a nice guy and the apartment is amazing. The best airbnb I've ever had!Will definitely come back!Xx
15331	133068747	42786	25754150	Yale	Staying at Myko's place was great. Easy in and out of the building, great accommodations, and a wonderful location in lower Manhattan within a couple of blocks of several subway stations for easy access to the entire city. Comfy bed, a nice powerful shower, shelf space, dresser space, and a rack with hangers for clothes you want to hang up. Highly recommend.
15331	135831363	42800	20662023	Aldain	Myko ' s apartment is truly a gem in the heart of the city. Impeccable facility with all the modern amenities you could ask for. Myko is super kind and has a big heart. I can see why his guests continue to give his listing such great reviews.Highly recommended! 
15331	137297262	42808	62657895	Lizzie	One of the best Airbnb experience so far - Myko's place is implacable - very clean, true to description, and great amenities in the building. The location is also very good - close to a lot of public transportation and literally on the Wall Street, which is a great feeling wondering within the area. Myko himself is a great host, too. I had booked the place the midnight before I moved in and he managed to provide me with very timely response, which is very reassuring. He's super nice to talk to, always being helpful, gives good tips for food and what to see in NYC, and makes you truly feel like home. I enjoyed my stay very much at Myko's place and will definitely stay with him again should I come back to NYC/recommend my friends/anyone who want to have a comfortable stay in NYC.  
15331	138648475	42814	118681033	Elijah	My wife and I visited NYC for the first time and spent 4 nights in one of Myko's rooms. There are 3 total rooms in the apartment and one bathroom --- which slightly concerned us, but it ended up being a complete non-issue. We never had to wait or compete for the bathroom.This location is so perfect. We had three major things on our to-do list: Statue of Liberty, One World Trade Center and Times Square.The first two of those things are within walking distance. A short walk at that. As well as The NY Stock Exchange, Battery Park, the 9/11 Memorial and lots of food/drink places. And Times Square (along with Rockefeller Center, Empire State Building, Grand Central Station, Central Park) are all an easy 15-minute subway ride away. And the closest subway station is a quick 4-minute walk.Myko was there occasionally, but we only saw him twice. Another room was occupied by a nice couple from Swedan, who we also only saw twice.It was out first time using Air BnB, although we had used similar services in the past. We had a late flight out, so we were slightly nervous about getting there and checking in, but Myko made it super easy. He said he was going to leave a key for us with the doorman, but he actually ended up waiting up! We didn't arrive until nearly 1 am on a Thursday night, but he was awake to greet us.The whole trip and stay was perfect. The location is perfect. It's safe and in a perfect spot to walk a lot of places. We only took two Uber rides the whole trip, and that was in and out of Newark airport. We only spent about $15 on subway fares. And we saw and did a lot. The NYC Half-Marathon ended up happening on the Sunday we were there, just out of coincidence, and the finish line was right outside of the building's front (URL HIDDEN) that was a fun little add-on to witness.I highly recommend this room and will definitely tell any friends/family stoping through NYC to stay at Myko's place!
30929	124717532	42737	107690209	Samm	We had a fantastic time here! We liked how we weren't right in the middle of New York and the metro is just up the road!Would totally recommend!
30929	128718892	42762	5383771	Silvia	The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
15730	124283689	42736	88771023	Taotao	It's a really good room. It's really convenient. The roommate is very friendly. Thx! 
8330	57699549	42366	185051	Musie	Cynthia and Ricky have put together a beautiful home that any Airbnb guest would enjoy staying at. Cozy, beautiful colors, artwork, and a kitchen with everything you could ever need to cook a meal( although I ate out every meal of the day, the food is so damn good in NYC). When I had to change my arrival plans last minute, they were very understanding and were able to accommodate me.Overall, beautiful home and very cool genuine hots that live in it. Thank you Cynthia and Ricky. You helped make my first trip to NYC a very special one. 
8330	60146713	42388	38204078	Becky	Cynthia's apartment was absolutely perfect!  Everything was exactly as described: clean, bright, and in the heart of Chelsea.  Cynthia communicated easily and was very accommodating.  I'm already looking forward to my next visit.  
8330	62736909	42416	6805524	Katharine	I will definitely visit Cynthia's adorable studio again! It was very comfortable, full of great energy, and in a convenient location! Cynthia was extremely hospitable and even left healing oil for me to use because I mentioned that I was recovering from an injury.  I had a great trip! 
8330	65372322	42442	15955053	Ayako	Cynthia was a responsive and welcoming host. The directions for check-in and check-out were very clear. The space is clean, cozy, and charming - I enjoyed looking through the books, spices, artworks, and other unique interior decorations. The sofa bed was very comfortable. The location is right next to the highline and few minutes walk to Chelsea Market, Whole Foods, art galleries, restaurants and cafe. I recommend this place to someone who's traveling alone and wants to experience living like a local in NY. 
8330	73084556	42496	18123688	Hannah	Cynthia's apartment was exactly as described. It was a bright and beautiful studio with a surprisingly comfortable sofa bed and great space. The location is ideal, with the highline and metro relatively close by.  The host was easy to contact and responsive to any questions i had. I stayed with my boyfriend, and would def stay in that area, and Cynthia's apartment again. Thanks very much for having us! 
38429	99930334	42619	12759869	Cassie	Leo was a very welcoming and gracious host. My coworker and I were in town for a month long work contract and we greatly enjoyed our stay. The nieghborhood was perfect. Located just off of south Bedford, we were close to many great local restaurants, shops, and bars. It was an easy walk to the L train Bedford stop (1 stop away from Manhattan) as well as the JMZ trains. The apartement itself was perfect and we absolutely loved it! Clean, light, airy and convenient, it had everything we needed! Two private bedrooms, each with a comfy queen size bed, as well as a very nice living space with a full dining table and comfortable couch. We really enjoyed our stay in Leo's place, the neighborhood, and our whole experience. We would highly recommend it! 
38429	104785385	42641	89096966	Phil	The flat was tidy and clean, is a good size, and the location of the flat is great - around 5 mins walk from 1 metro stop (Marcy) and 10-12 from another (Bedford). Bedford Ave also has a great selection of shops/bars/cafes etc. just around the corner. Note that the flat isn't actually a 'loft' - it is located on the ground foor and the bedrooms face the street. The front door also opens into the first bedroom. This was fine for us (two 30 y-o men) and felt safe, but got a little nosiy at times if we wanted a lie-in!
38429	111039260	42672	54525776	Anne Marie	TrÃ¨s bon accueil de LÃ©o, qui nous a permis de laisser nos valises jusqu'au dernier moment.L'appartement, trÃ¨s propre, correspond parfaitement Ã  la description. TrÃ¨s proche des transports, 1 ligne de mÃ©tro Ã  5mn et une seconde Ã  12 mon. Parfait pour les dÃ©placements. L'immeuble est  toutefois assez bruyant, surtout le week-end, notamment l'appartement du 1er Ã©tage. 
38429	113004310	42683	1289635	Alan	Leo was v speedy to respond and constantly liked that which helped enormouslyIt's in a good location 12 min walk or so from bedford on l trainThe bath can be improved to be honest - could only have shower there 
38429	114200672	42690	10753937	Eileen	Leo was willing to wait for us to check in, as my flight had gotten delayed. His home is beautiful, with two private bedrooms, which was perfect for me and my family. Great location, short walk to subway or next to bus stop. Not too much noise from the street, although it is next to the front door to the entire complex. We got used to the noise of people going in and out after two days. We would stay here again!
38429	116547329	42705	101970506	Daniel	Leo is an excellent host, he gave us all the directions we need to move around Williamsburg. The loft is near to the subway and you are in no time in manhattan. Totally recommendable!!
38429	121690485	42722	4129674	Alexandru	We had a great stay! Thanks for everything Leo!
38429	125223457	42739	103822021	Abel	Thanks, I read everything perfect
38429	126390511	42746	64021848	Malcolm	Leo's place is in a great location, it's just what we were looking for. The apartment was clean and modern, we had everything we needed. Will be back soon! 
38429	129391612	42765	5807326	Nina	We were a group of five friends, in NYC for a 8 days. The apartment worked really well, even for such a big group (some tip-toeing in the mornings involved). January got pretty cold, so the heaters in the apartment came in very handy. We spent a day without water, as the water was shut off due to some construction in the street - neither us or Leo had forewarning of this, but it didn't end up bothering us, as we were out most days. Leo has put a lot of effort into the design and look of the apartment, and it really shows. Everything is clean, thought out and functional. The location is excellent, right by the Williamsburg bridge, several great restaurants, shops and yoga studios. We'd happily recommend the place to anyone, and would definitely stay again next time. 
38429	132041158	42781	24902991	Lucy	Leoâ??s apartment is in a great location in Williamsburg â?? right next to the Williamsburg Bridge and Bedford Ave which is full of great bars, restaurants and shops, plus the metro is close by so you have easy access to Manhattan. The apartment itself is relatively basic but comfortable and looks exactly like the pictures which is good. There were lots of plug sockets which is handy for a 6 person place and the TV also is hooked up to free Netflix etc which was cool. There were however some issues with the rental:(URL HIDDEN) The property has no heating aside from two plug in heaters. During our stay it snowed and we were completely freezing during the night â?? even struggling to sleep at points. I'm sure it would be fine in warmer weather but not so great in winter. (URL HIDDEN) The bathroom had drainage issues in the sink and the bath meaning that water collected after each shower. This wasnâ??t very pleasant given that 6 people had to shower each morning.However the most serious issue we had was with the host. On the second night when we returned to the property in the early evening the lock to the apartment door would not open and we were stranded outside in the snow. We called/emailed/text the host for hours and he did not respond.We were left with no choice but to call a locksmith and had to spend $250 of our own money on this. The locksmith confirmed that we were not at fault at that there had been a malfunction with the door.The host finally got in touch in the early hours of the morning - by which time we had gained access to the property. We met with the host a couple of days later to discuss the situation and reimbursement. He was rather confrontational and aggressive and suggested that we were at fault even though the locksmith confirmed otherwise.He stated that he would only agree to reimburse us if we agreed to not give him a bad review (which essentially felt like a bribe) and also insinuated he had made agreements like this with guests before (money reimbursed for false reviews).We are currently going through the air bnb resolution centre to get the money for the lock returned to us but Leo has not responded to any requests as yet. Obviously a lock breaking is not an ordinary occurance but Leo's lack of communication with us caused us to miss an entire evening of our holiday - not to mention leaving us out of pocket. 
38429	136243931	42803	32452622	Rodney	Leos apartment really couldn't be much  better. This location in Williamsburg is dotted with great restaurants, bakeries and bars, and is very close to 2 subway stops, making Manhattan very accessible. The apartment is very clean and tastefully decorated. The beds are very comfortable and linen and towels were clean and of a nice quality.  There's good wifi and a TV with available Netflix. The kitchen is equipped with fridge, microwave,  and 4 countertop burners. Leo made us feel very welcome and was always extremely helpful. Would certainly recommend his apartment. 
38429	139273983	42818	14792587	Antonis	This location in Williamsburg is dotted with great restaurants, bakeries and bars, and is very close to 2 subway stops, making Manhattan very accessible. The apartment is clean and tastefully decorated. The beds are very comfortable and linen and towels were clean and of a nice quality. There's good wifi and a TV with available Netflix. The kitchen is equipped with fridge, microwave, and 4 countertop burners. Would certainly recommend his apartment. Although there were some issues. we were booked the house for 2 weeks with my 4 friends. In the rental Leo didn't include to clean the house at least one time between these 2 weeks. As we all understand the beddings and towels were not clean enough after the first 5 days. Also  staying with 5 people who all have to take a bath every day ,caused a cleaning issue to the bathroom also. i asked him if there is cleaning day included(as i suppose it should exist for so long days of rental) in the rental and he told me not and the cost if i want is 120 dollars(which is the same cost that i have already paid for cleaning fee, which include the cleaning before my arrival and after i leave) so we consider the cost too high. Second issue was the heating. we arrived late at night in the house and Leo was there for us to give us some instructions.the house was cold and there were 2 small electrical heatings. the temperature that night was 0 degrees. We asked him if this would be enough and he was very sure that this will be enough(i want to add that i had already asked him about the heating before my arrival after i checked another review that he had and the customer was complaining that the house was too much cold. the answer was that he didn't have any complains in the past so everything will be good). The result this night was to freeze and i woken up at 5am to send an email to leo because the cold was not acceptable and  we were struggling to sleep. I want to mention the leo responded very soon and the next day the issue was resolved by opening the central heating of the house, after this the house was very warm.if these two issues were prevented, this would have been the perfect stay.Also leo helped us and left us leave our bags the last day for 5 hours extra of our checkout because we had a late flight in the evening.Also we followed all his instructions for cleaning everything we used in the kitchen and generally in the house.Hope to resolve these issues and generally speaking its a very good choice for staying in New York.
4659	2676682	41203	3870959	Janina	We had a very pleasent stay at Firo and Maria's place. We felt really welcome and we were offered beverages and dinner when we arrived. Their visiting children were really nice and we had a good chat with them. The room was good, clean and quiet (and exactly as in the picture). Maria and Firo prepared breakfast for us the next morning and we felt really comfortable. They treated us like a part of their family. We can really recommend staying with Firo and Maria!
4659	2742609	41210	910315	Denice	Firo & Maria were very sweet and very accommodating!  Nice neighborhood for parking and very clean room!  Very comfortable bed!  
4659	2962543	41238	244934	Ahmed	We were on a two day visit to New York, and we gladly stayed with Porfirio and Maria. A very nice room, with everything you might need. They were very welcoming and gracious. Also the neighborhood was a great place to find parking. It made our trip much more convenient.
4659	3010168	41245	4114687	Kevin	Firo and Maria were such gracious hosts.  I was so impressed with their attention to detail and their hospitality.  They were so nice to stay with and I would definitely reserve a room from them again.  Maria found out I liked coffee and was very happy to make it available all the time.  Having a desk in the room in order to telecommute was also a great plus.  The area around their home is also a very nice part of Borough Park -- just one block and there are lots of Chinese and other restaurants on 8th and their home was also very close to the subway and other restaurants.  Getting to Manhattan took just a matter of minutes -- you will not regret staying with Firo and Maria!  What a nice couple and such a great experience staying with them!
4659	3026850	41247	3218087	Dimitri	Firo and Maria are incredibly gracious hosts.  They offered me dinner and breakfast and welcomed me in as a member of their family. Walking distance to Maimonides hospital. 
4659	3097011	41259	3703945	Kaveh	Very lovely family. They gave me full breakfast everyday.  Great location if interviewing at Maimonides hospital.
4659	4999349	41431	2767198	Eli	Porfirio and Maria were very helpful and accommodating.  The apartment was clean and had all the amenities that we needed.  They made us feel extra special by serving us coffee in the morning and even asking if we wanted some juice when they came home from grocery shopping.  They also installed an air conditioner in our room to make it cooler in the nights.The last day we had some emergency issues we needed to deal with and forgot to tell them we had changed our check out time - they contacted us and were very helpful considering our forgetfulness in communications.The apartment is on ground level, which was nice to not walk up stairs but on the Friday night it was a bit noisy outside.  The rest of the week the neighborhood was quite.Overall we loved our experience and would highly recommend this apartment to others.
4659	5607040	41463	2474153	Ferrin	Firo and Maria were both very nice and welcoming. I stayed with them about 2 1/2 weeks. The room is nice and had everything I needed. The downside is there isn't a real door to the room. It's a folding door with slats missing so it didn't feel very private and it provided pretty much no sound barrier.  So if they had family over or music on in the living room I could hear everything. The location is ok as it is close to the train and it was good for me because it was close to the new job I was starting. Overall, I would say this room is nice but not worth the money they are charging.
4659	6296665	41492	3090866	Jean-Michel	What a lovely couple and a wonderful room! We ended up 4 hours late due to a closed bridge, detours, and getting lost, but they were still welcoming and so polite. Our stay was comfortable, thank you so much. 
4659	6832330	41512	2362587	Anthony	Firo and Maria are great people! They are very friendly and flexible.The place was near the subway, so we could easily venture out to the rest of the city
4659	7086221	41522	6896561	Andreas	These guys are wonderful hosts!!! We spent a great time in New York and felt like home at their apartment. They are respectful, helpful, very agreeable and polite; it was a pleasure to meet them!!Thank You very very much!!
4659	7211505	41527	154081	Aydan	Porfirio and Maria were great host, they opened the door to us with a big smile! Everything was perfect the room was so nice and very clean, they were very very nice people , we loved them. Because of our busy schedule we couldn't see them a lot but Maria was so thoughtful and she left bananas and cereals on the kitchen table ,the table was set when we woke up!They share their milk with us , they were very generous. The neighborhood was safe in the subway was just 4 min walk. D train was running frequently and it was 20-30 min ride to the city! Overall  our experience was great! I would definitely stay there again if I visit NYC. Thanks to Porfirio and Maria for their great hospitality.
4659	7440968	41537	8480305	Jennifer	What I was looking for was a low cost, clean, private room near the subway. That is exactly what I got. The apartment was tiny but Maria and Firo gave us as much privacy as we wanted. They also happily provided us with anything we needed from ice packs to advice on where to do laundry. The room was very clean, with a/c, internet and cable TV and a comfortable bed. It was the perfect place to crash after a busy day sightseeing. I would gladly stay with them again and enjoyed visiting a section of New York that I never would have seen otherwise. We enjoyed immersing ourselves in the diverse neighborhood. The security was top-notch. The access to the subway was a big plus. 
4659	7919930	41555	8454367	Danny	Firo and Maria were wonderful hosts.  Maria took plenty of time to help us settle in and even helped us set up our air mattress with sheets.  This was an excellent, no hassle experience in a great, comfortable room, I would highly recommend them!
4659	8300113	41571	9298217	Michael	"Quiet neighborhood, convenient to restaurants and grocery stores, subway line ""D"" is nearby"
4659	8456242	41578	8706371	Carmel	Firo and Maria's BnB is clean and quiet. I stayed for a single night and they were both friendly and hospitable. The subway was within reasonable walking distance and I was able to complete all the tasks I had set myself for my last day in NYC. 
4659	8630328	41587	734082	Nav	Firo and Maria were wonderful and helpful hosts. They provided me information regarding taxi service, restaurants in the area. The house was in a quiet neighborhood and I had complete privacy during my stay. 
4659	8698976	41590	3974254	Sumant	Firo and Maria's place in Brooklyn NY is amazing. Located conveniently within 3 of blocks from the Subway, it is a gated secure apartment building. The room was the most spacious room I have ever seen in any apartment in NY(you can probably fit in 2 queen mattresses in there and still have space for your table and chair). You have a full size bed with fresh laundered sheets and towels and everything was clean, and room was really warm, just what you need coming back after visiting the cold NY streets. The restroom was shared but very clean. And Firo and Maria were really nice. They received me well when I arrived, gave me my set of keys and information about places to eat around as well as wifi access. They provided me with an iron that I needed to iron my clothes. I was even offered coffee and some fruits the morning I left. All in all, it is a nice family home to stay if you are visiting and looking to stay in the company of a warm and kind family !!
4659	8798339	41596	6607258	Ricky	Had an excellent stay at Mr. and Mrs. Caba's home. They were very hospitable and accommodating. The room was was clean and had everything it was advertised to have. I would have no problem staying at their house and recommending anyone who wants to stay at a nice clean place in New York City.
4659	8911025	41603	4205577	Nayomi	Firo and Maria's place in Brooklyn NY is very close to two train stations (where we took the D train to connect to everything!)  This is a gated secure apartment building. The room was the most spacious room I have ever seen in any apartment in NY, with a computer and free wifi. You have a full size bed with fresh laundered sheets and towels and shampoo to boot.  The room was warm enough and they provided us with an extra blanket if needed.    The restroom was shared but very clean; we did not have any run-ins with needing to use the rest room.  You can hear people outside, however it didn't last long and we were asleep in seconds!  Firo and Maria were really nice and accommodating; I had a nose bleed problem and Maria was very helpful. Firo received my mother and I when we arrived and gave us a set of keys and provided us with food ideas. They are a very kind and humble couple and we would not hesitate to stay with them at some point in the future, should we visit Brooklyn again!  
4659	9003344	41609	308962	Nicole	Firo and Maria were lovely hosts.  The room was large and cozy with everything you need.  Convenient location, 2 blocks from the D train.
4659	12382871	41759	12060838	Zilu	Firo is a nice guy and he gave us a wonderful reception. Bedroom is good, everything is clean. The only thing lower the overall rate is bathroom. shower head is old and hot water can hardly be controlled. 
4659	13160737	41779	15200737	Sowon	Awesome location in Brooklyn, only a couple blocks away from the subway. The host is super kind. There is a computer in the room and wifi which help a lot when you are traveling and need to find info. Highly recommend this place for anyone!
4659	14968223	41820	15355979	Mike	My son and I stayed with Firo and Maria for 8 days and had absolutely no issues. Cozy apartment,  comfy bed,  strong shower. Our first time with airbnb so wasnt sure what to expect but our hosts were incredibly friendly and so helpful with directions. Neighborhood is quiet, very culturally diverse. And two blocks from subway which is great after walking around New York City All day.  It was nice staying in an actual neighborhood in Brooklyn, it gives more of a feeling of the area and its people. We would certainly stay there again
4659	15721546	41834	17623508	Puttiporn	The place was so nice and lovely. Also, Firo and Maria were so kind with us. 
4659	15864224	41837	14958939	Frank	We stayed with Firo and Maria for 3 days, felt highly welcome and had absolutely no issues. Cozy apartment, well sized room, bed large enough for two tall people and very clean.It was our first time with airbnb and we were not sure what to expect but our hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful with directions. Maria and Firo let us feel to be at home. Neighborhood is safe, quiet, very culturally diverse. Walking distance to subway is rather short. It was nice staying in a living borrow. We explored the feeling how life flows there. We would certainly stay there again
4659	16215372	41843	17171553	Branden	We had a great stay! The house was very clean and everyone was very friendly and helpful! Thanks!
4659	16273723	41844	6668453	Charles	The room in Firo and Maria's apartment was comfortable and spacious. Firo and Maria were more than accommodating, despite my very late (11pm) arrival. I was given a towel and a small bag of shampoo, soap, conditioner, apartment keys, etc. Internet signal was good. Although the apartment is almost an hour by subway from Grand Central Terminal, the D train is just two blocks away. Also, the Sunset Park neighborhood is interesting on its own; I didn't mind being far from Manhattan.
4659	16421263	41847	17578112	Adele	Maria fulfilled her role as host graciously. I only saw Firo the morning I left. She provided me with cold water, which was welcomed, especially after the flight from the West Coast. The room was clean and there were the requisite towel and basic toiletries. I wasn't sure what to expect from the neighborhood, but it hasn't undergone the gentrification that many Brooklyn neighborhoods have in the past 20 years or so. While you cannot find the cafe, it is worth it to see neighborhoods that are still diverse.
4659	16999728	41856	17792929	Patricia	Maria and Firo were perfect hosts! We were provided with roomy space, good comfortable bed, clean and neat bathroom. When we had questions about trains or restaurants, we were given correct answers which were clearly explained. Extras such as umbrellas and flip flops to wear inside were provided. Everything was lovely and welcoming. Whenever I go to NY, I only want to stay with Maria and Firo! They were very kind and warm to us. Much more welcoming than any hotel, a very happy family, nice family neighborhood, close to subway. We felt safe and could walk around the neighborhood easily. You will not be disappointed!
4659	17206696	41860	16091269	Silvia	We had a great stay! The house was very clean the room had great size with large bed. Maria was very friendly and helpful! Highly recommend this place for anyone!
4659	17829048	41869	4704906	Ivan	Firo and Maria are wonderful, quiet and repectful hosts, they offered us towels, bath supplies just like in a hotel, but with house warmth and hospitality. Very nice people.The place is clean and comfortable, there was big bed and wardrobe. It is nice place to stay. There are many places to eat nearby (asian, italian, etc) and also Firo offered us place in the fridge and let us use the kitchen.
4659	17983090	41870	4117699	Leda	I needed a place for one night between house sits, and FIro and Maria's place worked out perfectly. Safe if not glamorous neighborhood with delis, coffee shops, etc. nearby. Short walk from the subway. Very comfortable bed and room, and clean apt. They were both very nice.
4659	18811256	41883	18831363	Antonio	Estuvimos en la casa muy agusto. Tanto por la habitaciÃ³n como por los dueÃ±os. Estos eran muy amables. El barrio era bastante tranquilo. La descripciÃ³n se ajustaba perfectamente al anuncio y a las fotos. Las comunicaciones con el metro cerca estaban bien. El wifi y el aire acondicionado funcionaban bien. 
4659	19267474	41891	5000175	Nara	Staying at Firo and Maria's place was just lovely. Clean and cozy. Loved the cultural diversity of the neighborhood! I recommend the place to everyone who visits NY! 
4659	19319292	41892	5000175	Nara	A very lovely place. Firo and Maria were both welcoming and gentle. I really loved spending 5 days at Firo's place with my sister! 
4659	19675995	41898	18323942	Robert	My room was spacious, clean, and comfortable. My hosts were gracious, helpful, and unobtrusive. During my three night stay, our paths seldom crossed. The neighborhood, like most of Brooklyn, is an incredible mix of cultures - and all the better for it. Parking can be difficult, but I was able to leave my car on the other side of town for the first two days, and on the last night parked in a garage recommended by Firo. Access to the Metro is very easy; there are stations for both the R and D lines within a 15 minute walk of the apartment. Both have booths staffed 24 hours a day. Be sure to download the Metro app to your smart phone and/or pick up a free system map at the station. I did a lot of walking and never felt apprehensive about it, whatever the time of day or wherever in Brooklyn I happened to be. A terrific experience that I would gladly repeat.
4659	21124262	41924	18338572	Enzo	Secure neighborhood (jewish), close to subway. Big bedroom, hot water and they were very kind by giving a space in the fridge and sharing things like sugar or salt. They gave us some recommendations which help us during the trip and also to eat near the house. Maria was very kind with my little 5 months son and she babysat our baby for one night while we went to Broadway.Few things we didn't like. It's supossed to be  Bed & Breakfast but they just offered us coffee on the first day. Second, you get charged 5 dollars per day as cleaning fee, but they never cleaned our room, we stayed 7 days, so $35 for nothing.After those things, we just needed the room to fall sleep as soon as we arrived to the house, so it was what we were looking for. Thanks for the hospitality.
4659	21387804	41928	21195454	Peng	Firo and Maria are very nice and flexible hosts. Their room is very clean and comfortable. The apartment is 5 min's walk from the subway station. The neighborhood is very safe. I had a very pleasant stay in their room.
4659	22991604	41962	13271839	Emily	Great experience! a short walk to Maimonides Medical Center, which is what I was looking for. The room was very clean and well-heated, the hosts were very nice & welcoming. 
4659	23954768	41988	18753407	John	Great
4659	30520592	42117	29641871	Dmitry	The room is large and comfortable, close to the subway, the family friendly. Thank you for a good reception.
4659	32209244	42139	24736785	Anton	Firo good hosts. Room large and close to the subway. Use of the kitchen is not convenient. Taxi from the airport cost us $ 70, but back to the airport Firo helped us call a taxi and it saved us money, just 40$. Thanks!
4659	32435088	42141	714836	Antall	The place was just perfect. The room was clean and spacious. The place is conveniently located near the subway which is great if you need to get into NY. We only had the chance to meet Maria and she was very welcoming. 
4659	33158166	42149	338502	Jeffrey	The space was clean, private, and close to where we needed to be in the city. Porfirio and Maria were very welcoming, and the apartment had everything we needed. 
4659	33336075	42150	27670084	Rachael	Great place! Apartment is so cute and welcoming. Firo and Maria are very warm and helpful hosts. My friend and I arrived at different times, my friend arriving very late and they were happy to stay up and make sure she got there ok. This is my second time staying at their place and will definitely look for them again if I'm ever in Brooklyn. 
4659	33630668	42154	13992047	Paul	A large room in quiet, safe, ethnically mixed neighborhood: Hasidic Jews, Dominicans, Mexicans, and Chinese, with a sprinkling of the whole rest of the world. The simple apartment is nice and clean. Firo was working nights, so I only saw him a bit, but he was very warm and welcoming. Maria is a lovely woman, and also very warm. It's only a few blocks to the D train, and only a few blocks to Brooklyn's Chinatown. My stay was 3 nights â?? I was in the city to visit my daughter and her family, who live in a tiny apartment about a mile away, so I did little at Firo and Maria's beyond sleeping and showering. My next trip to NYC is only another week away, and I would have loved to stay at Firo and Maria's place a second time, but they were already booked.
4659	34470171	42163	32967605	Stefano	Firo and Maria were a good hosts , friendly and flexible, family atmosphere. The room was clean and large at 5 minutes from the subway . The neighborhood is safe and quiet .
4659	34833747	42167	33275085	Franchesca	They were friendly and nice.
4659	38452334	42200	37877833	Katie	I was so nervous about going to New York for the first time by myself, but Maria and Firo made me feel so at home and on such short notice. I booked a stay with them the morning of my flight because my prior arrangements fell thorough and they were so quick to respond. I really believe that they made my whole trip. The room was great and they were the best hosts, and if I don't have a place booked for my next adventure to New York they'll be first on my list! It was overall such a great experience and stay with them. I highly recommend Maria and Firo to everyone(:
4659	42069621	42226	7363789	Margarita	While the room was very simple, it was also very clean - which was the most important thing for us. We only spent one night, but our stay was comfortable. The hosts were very nice and polite. 
4659	42589113	42230	31305379	Dawn	The family was very nice and welcoming without being the least bit intrusive. The room is quite spacious with a closet, mini-refrigerator, computer and desk, as well as a window a/c unit, which I needed since I was there in August. I was a tad leery about sharing an apartment but, again, Portirio and Firo were not the least bit intrusive. Lovely stay.
4659	42990299	42232	36153503	Gabriel	Porfirio and Maria were wonderful. They welcomed me with much kindness. I arrived some hours before the scheduled check in, but Porfirio and Maria let me check in in advance. You can park for free just before their building in Brooklyn. Thank you Maria and Porfirio !
4659	43426814	42235	40345045	Qingyun	Firo and Maria are very nice people. We really have a very nice three-days there. The room is cozy and clean. And the neighbor is very quiet.
4659	44601327	42243	32722280	Boris	Great hosts-- everything worked out perfectly!
4659	46205136	42255	42072542	Moritz	We had a very great time with Firo and Maria. The room was very clean and in a nice neighbourhood in walking distance to the subway. We would be happy to stay with them again when we come back to New York next time.
4659	46534925	42258	41424982	Kea	The host were wonderful.
4659	46677776	42259	43728268	Junior	Me sentÃ­ muy agradecido de que me brindaran su casa para poder realizar mi tour por nueva york. La casa esta ubicada cerca del metro lo que me facilito la movilizaciÃ³nentre brooklin y manhathan.Me brindaron buenos consejos de que lugares y en que momento seria bueno visitar, me ayudo mucho para decidir como realizar mi tour.
4659	48244914	42271	11363827	Bukola	Firo and Maria's house was immaculately clean.  Their neighbourhood was also very safe and commute was convenient as the metro was only a couple of blocks away. My husband and I loved the experience. Both Firo and Maria were quite warm and friendly. However; I think they should consider putting a proper door to the guest room  to improve privacy especially for married couples. All in all a great experience and would recommend them 100%
4659	49137581	42278	40573511	Tania	La experiencia en casa de Porfidio fue genial!! HabitaciÃ³n amplia cÃ³moda y muy limpia!Buena ubicaciÃ³n para visitar Nueva York Muy serviciales y atentos Un trato inmejorableRecomendable totalmente!!
4659	49299122	42279	39274139	Van	Great spot!  Close to the subway (D), clean, quiet and convenient.  I arrived a little later than I anticipated, but communication was great.
4659	49942275	42284	44884752	Yousef	They are very respectful and helpfull. We arrived a little earlier but they fully welcomed us. Also, their apartment is so clean and beautiful. The location is also very close to subway, so you can take subway to go to Manhattan easily. I strongly recommend it to every one
4659	50106498	42286	44373732	Gowri	Porfirio and Maria were very friendly. Room was very neat and was very close to subway (D). We spent only one night at their place and it was very comfortable. The room doesn't have a lock and bathroom was quite small but very neat and well maintained. We will definitely consider staying at their place during our next visit to New York. 
4659	50252919	42287	45760439	Tim	I had a very nice experience. Host was lovely. Room is large and clean. Mini fridge generously stocked with beverages awaits you upon arrival. Nice touch for sure when one is parched after a day of travel. Enjoyed a nice, reasonably priced meal at a local diner just a few blocks away. Only to be outdone by enjoying a gorgeous view of lower Manhattan during sunset at a nearby park. I would not hesitate to stay here again.
4659	51198619	42295	45577380	Lois	Nice place, Nice neighborhood, nice people very available, very discreet. Thanks again!
4659	51383861	42296	31035532	Yana	My husband and I stayed at Portfirio and Maria's for just one night. We basically needed a nice place to sleep in between New York sightseeing and we were very happy with our choice.The room is clean and comfortable, there's wi-fi :) We were provided with towels and some bathroom necessities.I will definitely recommend staying with Firo and Maria.
4659	52348058	42305	29822660	Luis R.	"Firo and Maria were excellent hosts! Their home had all the necessities I needed to make it through my 4-day stay. The neighborhood in Brooklyn was perfect, and their location was only 2 blocks from the subway station. There's a really good coffee shop on 42nd St. Which I frequented every morning called ""Parlay"". Perfect way to start your day. If your into Asian food, there are countless shops and restaurants just one block over where you'll find Pho', Bahnmi sandwiches, and fresh sea food. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay and I would most definitely recommend their home for anyone considering a short stay in New York."
4659	53019422	42311	31028823	Michel	MÃªme si nous Ã©tions en retard de 2h, Maria nous a accueillis avec le sourire. Le logement est trÃ¨s propre, mÃªme s'il est petit. La nuit, c'est bruyant, Ã  cause des bruits dans l'Ã©difice (portes) et sur la rue. La salle de bain est trÃ¨s petite. La porte coulissante de la chambre nous amÃ¨ne directement au salon, ce qui ne favorise pas l'intimitÃ©.
4659	53090680	42312	26792384	Benson	Maria was kind enough to allow me to spend a night at their home. She was very helpful in getting ideas of things to do nearby, as well as giving me privacy. The room was clean and setup well, overall it was a very enjoyable experience, would recommend to anyone! 
4659	53777450	42320	47831532	Victor	Good, clean and comfortable room, close to the subway! Firo and Maria are very hospitable and nice hosts! Thank you very much! We recommend this apartment! :)
4659	54832503	42331	11136069	Sohaib	Porfirio and Maria are gracious hosts and a pleasure to interact with. They were very accommodating throughout my stay. Highly recommended.
4659	55502291	42339	43303902	Eli	The nice place with the nice hosts
4659	55539805	42339	5526576	Ibraheem	This is a good place. Firo and Maria made me feel very welcome. Their description was accurate. The room was clean and spacious.  The shared bathroom was clean. The house was about 5 block walk from the metro-stop. The neighborhood feels safe even though it doesn't look like it. 
4659	58043326	42369	28177135	Anna	The location is awesome. Near to 8th street and D train. The hosts are very nice. The room is clean.
4659	59289979	42378	32379631	Nikki	Friendly hosts! Convenient location to interview at Maimonides! 
4659	64098504	42429	21851061	Art	Firo and Maria were very hospitable and immediately made us feel welcome. The guest bedroom in their apartment is clean and quiet, with a comfortable bed and shared bath, just as they advertise it.  Not only is wifi available, but a Mac computer is made available for their guests' use.  Each morning, Maria offered us a lovely bowlful of various freshly cut fruits and oj! The apartment is convenient to the D train, and the neighborhood offers an interesting mix of Chinese, Hispanic, and other ethnic shops and eateries. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay.
4659	71164631	42484	67739161	Jessica	Firo and Maria were very nice. The room they are listing was very spacious and clean. It's very close to subway and took about half an hour to midtown Manhattan. I recommend this room!
4659	72556927	42493	61132323	Yevhen	Very welcome and kind people. The apartment looks the same as on photo. Close to metro station and quiet district.
4659	74462718	42505	60080209	Neckea	Porfirio and Maria were wonderful hosts! The apartment was easy to find and the bedroom was very large. The apartment was also conveniently located next to the subway which made traveling vert easy. We really enjoyed our stay and would recommend it to anyone! 
4659	75493387	42511	8529335	Jacquie	Porfirio's home was what we expected from the reviews. We didn't meet her husband but she and her daughter were lovely. Communication was prompt, even when we changed our arrival time . The bed was comfortable and the neighborhood safe. Very muticultural. It's near the Greenwood Cemetery. We wanted to tour but the trolley doesn't run until Memorial weekend.  I would stay here again. 
4659	76743851	42519	57454470	Steve	Everything was very nice. My wife and I stayed for 1 night, and Firo was very good with communication. Maria was very welcoming. The place was clean. It would been nice to have a tv in the room. But after spending time out in the city, we were tired. So it didn't matter to us.Brooklyn was very nice. Diverse people and full of energy. I was lucky to had found a parking spot on the street between restricted times. 
4659	77044648	42520	20369144	Erick	Listing was accurate and host was very welcoming. Great stay. 
4659	77504774	42522	67643527	Saishankar	Firo and Maria are awesome people, they were extremely hospitable and made us feel at home. I booked the place for 10 days for my parents who were visiting New York for my graduation. The room is spacious is clean and the place is safe and close to the subway. The listing says extra people could stay free of charge but I paid $15/night when my brother wanted to spend a night at their place. Overall I would definitely recommend this place.
4659	77766166	42524	74847472	Thomas	Maria and Firo were very accommodating and welcoming. Great neighborhood and nice place to stay with great amenities for the price point. I'd highly recommend!
4659	78319832	42527	40805	Namit	Extremely hospitable hosts. Waited late in the evening for me to arrive.
4659	78564221	42528	75905528	Sean	Very sweet older couple .They claim clean n quiet.Clean yes ...QUIET not so much ,they have a pic of just the two of them , they should include there 2 year old grandson who they watch from 8am till at least 4:30-5pm .... Being he's so young he doesn't understand someone's trying to sleep in the Japanese paper style sliding door just 3 ft away from where he plays,and man does that kid have a set of lungs on him. I Had a long day n late night n didn't plan on waking up 3 hrs b4 check out ..also check in is at 3 ,I paid around 2:30pm,walked around aimlessly untill they finally got back to me around 4pm and was invited over.. UPSIDE ,they had a mini fridge n gave me 2 bottles of water,best of all they have a DVD player hooked up to there mac next to the bed,if u can hear it over the baby ...All n all Overpriced n for the location & for someone who just wanted to (URL HIDDEN) was not my cup of tea and would not stay there again....
4659	81830759	42546	56319443	Lindsey	Fantastic hosts. They had cold water waiting for me when I arrived and went out of their way to be accommodating. Couldn't ask for a better stay. 
4659	82537257	42549	24089503	Ronald	We were very pleased with our stay here. Portfolio and Maria were very accommodating to all our needs from check in to check out.  The bath room was a bit tiny but did not affect our enjoyable experience. I would recommend   this listing to anyone who is value conscious and wasn't looking to live in the lap of luxury.
4659	83241988	42553	56319443	Lindsey	Great! 
4659	85100052	42561	74541556	Kang-Chieh	Nice couple and clean room. I sleep very well that night!
4659	87318138	42570	79055941	Anthony	I couldn't have asked for a better pair of hosts. Honestly, it felt like I was staying with a friend's parents. They were both more than willing to work around any situation that may have come up and didn't ask for anything unreasonable. They were an irreplaceable part of my visit and I would highly recommend them to anyone else without thinking twice.
4659	88374912	42575	39976716	Mike	Only saw Maria, great lady, the bedroom was very clean and the bed is big and really comfortable. Good location and good price!
4659	88515803	42575	82935299	Zafar	Apartment owners are wonderful people and create all the conditions and convenience. It was nice to stay with these people.
4659	92025331	42589	10138731	ä½³æ¬£	It was a wonderful experience.Room clean and warm, the owner enthusiasm enthusiastic. The next will come.
4659	97927855	42611	12975586	Ryan	Nice room, close to where we needed to be and the subway, very nice hosts.
4659	101125642	42625	59085963	Erika	I felt very welcome. They were very accommodating with my arrival time. They both were very nice. The apartment was clean. There is even a mini fridge in the room! 
4659	101673709	42627	31876780	Avanti	The couple was great about responding to me on time!The place was clean and the room was nice and spacious.The place is about a 10 min walk from the closest train station but definitely would recommend it!
4659	102601180	42631	91296324	Melissa	Very nice hosts...adequate for my visit. Great neighborhood.
4659	103093527	42633	91411210	Lenka	We felt welcomed and enjoyed our stay here. The location was very good, nice neighborhood and quiet. Everything was clean and neat. We had a good time. 
4659	103456161	42635	56370260	Lisa	Thanks for letting us stay at your lovely house!
4659	103847606	42637	74906441	Rashaun	
4659	105667163	42645	90811172	È?uÈ?u	Awesome couple.Very nice people and i will recommend them if you want to stay in Brooklyn.
4659	110955844	42672	20374467	Casey	Firo and Maria were great hosts, they were nice and trustworthy people. I felt safe in their apartment and in the neighborhood. It was perfect distance to Maimonides hospital. It is a 5 min walk to the hospital. However, the area isn't the best if you are looking to explore Brooklyn for its night life or bars. You can easily walk to the train (about 4 min away) to explore the rest of NYC.  
4659	126005688	42743	28506775	Zoran	Porfirio and Maria's apartment was in a great location in Brooklyn and was also a very comfortable and welcoming place. They allowed my fiancÃ© and I to leave our luggage until long after our scheduled check out so that we could explore Brooklyn for a few hours before our flight. They were very accommodating, responsive, and kind. Our room was very comfortable and spacious. I would recommend others to stay here!  
26328	51929377	42302	12908195	Bill	I work in NY midtown, and was between apartments for roughly a month, during which time I stayed with Sha in her midtown east apartment.  The apartment is very conveniently located, with access to various train lines and restaurants.  There is also a Whole Foods around the corner.The apartment was quiet, clean and spacious. Manhattan is noisy, but the apartment was surprisingly quiet with the windows closed, and I never had any noise related issues during my stay.  The room was large and completely private, and had ample natural light during the day.  The entire stay was exceedingly pleasant. Sha was always friendly and courteous, and frequently asked me whether I was comfortable and happy with my stay.  The few requests that I made were quickly addressed (e.g. more hangers)The building was newly renovated with a charge card operated laundry room in the basement. The doormen were very friendly, and never gave me any issues during the entirety of my stay.I was a little uneasy with going through Airbnb for an extended stay, but this turned out to be a fantastic experience.  Sha is a caring and friendly host, and I am very grateful for her warm hospitality.
35519	37837675	42196	29698048	Joy	Rodolfo and his roommate, Rachel, were both very welcoming, warm and helpful. Myself and my husband had a great time staying with them in Washington Heights with easy access to the train, local parks and also close to the store. We felt at home straight away and nothing was too much trouble for them. The neighbourhood can be a little noisy due to being close to a main road which has plenty of traffic through it in the mornings. The neighbours were also very friendly which helped me feel at home very quickly. 
35519	46259391	42256	1219460	Sheer	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
35519	49250536	42279	43734843	Orianna	I had a great experience at Rodolfo's place! He provided everything I needed from towels/linens to space in the fridge. He was a very gracious host. 
35519	51454048	42297	39014449	Douglas Antonio	O Rodolfo Foi um Ã³timo anfitriÃ£o, nos munindo sempre de informaÃ§Ãµes, nos deixando bem a vontade na casa.  Nos deixou tudo disponÃ­vel na casa, sempre limpa e organizada e muito confortÃ¡vel. Tudo era exatamente como na descriÃ§Ã£o, muito prÃ³ximo ao centro de Manhattan. A roommate dele, Jilena tambÃ©m nos recebeu muito bom. Podiamos chegar a qualquer hora em casa, pois o bairro Ã© muito seguro e com vÃ¡rios mercados ao redor. Sem DÃºvidas recomendamos,  a casa do Rodolfo por ser muito limpa, confortÃ¡vel e sem surpresas.
35519	52327318	42305	3889144	Tal & Rennan	The apartment is great! The cleaning is perfect! the location is good, safe and easy to find! The hosts are extremely welcoming and made us feel at home. excellent value! worth the price!
35519	52708496	42309	44373388	Andrea	The apart. is great, clean and perfect! The location is near by two subways and 25 minutes to Times Square. Rodolfo and his roommate Jelena have organized everything for our comfortable stay. Everything was great and satisfied.
35519	71984123	42490	15858969	Juliana	The host Rodolfo and his roomie Yelena are very kind, interesting, and dynamic people. They were extremely welcoming, warm and helpful --they actually made me feel at home. The brand new apartment is great and the room was perfect for a four-month season. It was my best experience at Airbnb!  
35519	76814114	42519	36724206	Adria	I stayed at Rodolfo's place almost one month. He's really nice, polite and accommodating. He offered items and space in his apartment for my use. His roommate, Jelena, was also awesome. Both are nice and friendly, while also being low-key and quiet, a perfect balance!
35519	108102967	42657	77571416	Tom	Rodolfo was a great host and very accomadating 
35519	122024079	42724	10250472	John Allen	Wonderful place to stay! Very clean, and easily accessed from both the 1 train and A train. The building had an updated door system; very easy to get in and out. Any issue that I may have had were taken care of quick and responsibly. Rodolfo and Dustin were very kind and made me feel right at home! 
40574	111245096	42673	4168197	Peyton	"This was truly a first for me. First off, the host is listing this place under a false name/photo. This was later admitted via text message and made me extremely uncomfortable.The host said he didn't want to list his real name and only used his middle name. Funny that his middle name was completely different than his real name. He also had a fake picture listed, and then when I told him this via text he changed it to another picture of someone who looks SIMILAR to the 'live-in' host. (He even said it still wasnt him)Then, there was the fact that several items were stolen from my room. To the hosts credit (there's actually two hosts. One live in, one that must work for the management company that runs this place) I was refunded the money for the sweater....but the first defense was 'Well If you read the listing we didn't say there were locks on the doors'. Omitting that massive detail isn't an excuse, especially when you fail to mention there are going to be several other bedrooms with HEAVY foot traffic and no locker or something to secure your things. Also, they had a nest camera (they added another one) set up pointed at the rooms that did nothing but make the other guests comfortable.Thankfully they installed a lock on my door the next day.The worst part is that the 'live-in' host was incredibly rude on almost every occasion. I had something mailed to the address and he un-apologetically told me that 'I should have told him before' because he didn't have a mailbox key TO ""HIS OWN"" APARTMENT.The coup de grÃ¢ce was when, on checkout day, I reminded the host that I had a late flight and hoped I could stay a few more hours.(something I asked initially but was never responded to). He said no, the checkout was 11 but I could leave my stuff outside the room so they could prep it. No biggie, right? Well at 11:00 sharp he knocked on the door and obnoxiously said 'It's 11, you need to go'. I explained that I had been extremely reasonable given the circumstances I experienced thus far (1. False identification of the host 2. Stolen items). I explained that I agreed to leave a good review since Dominick (Listed as 'Yann') paid me back for my sweater. Upon hearing this, he claimed I was extorting him and he was going to call the police. His girlfriend (who was working illegally as the maid) also came in the room and shouted at me at the same time saying 'You knew the policy!'. Yeah folks, this wasn't the Ritz so i'm not going to treat it that way. Avoid like the plague folks. Should have booked another place when I found out they were listing it under a fake name but nothing in the area was available last minute. Worst airbnb experience I've ever had. This place is nightmare fuel"
40574	112316658	42679	100559524	Mateusz	All was ok and as described 
40574	112534609	42680	80763925	Anna	Well set up, convenient!
40574	113936769	42688	101446241	Kaitlyn	Very spacious, clean, and a convenient location.
40574	124761674	42737	78867823	Feli	The location and hosts are really nice and the Apartment is easy to find as well. However, it is not possible to lock the bedroom from the outside. There are three bathrooms, which is really nice.
40574	128303067	42758	19524831	Marcus	I usually don't write reviews... but I have to for this Airbnb. Marc was extremely personable and the place was extremely clean and renovated, very surprised with the value. 10/10 would stay again. 
40574	133592516	42789	51732478	Kei	His house is very large but really neat and comfortable.There are 3 bathrooms in the house, so you don't need to wait for taking shower.The location is also good.You can access subway stations within 10minutes!
40574	134299069	42792	1877652	Matthieu	Place is very spacious and clean, Marc was nice! It's a good deal!
40574	136096805	42802	29795747	Hernan	Marc a sido muy atento en recibirnos y nos facilitÃ³ un montÃ³n de informaciÃ³n sobre el barrio.
40574	137598743	42810	62989776	Michael	Back to basics. Not bad for overall value
40574	139430354	42819	29795747	Hernan	La zona es mÃ¡s cerca de bushwick que williamsburg, hay dos estaciones a 4 cuadras cada una lo cual es muy bueno. De noche es seguro. Es difÃ­cil entrar al alojamiento si no conoces el sistema de locker.
18523	5073679	41435	2208430	Michael	What a great deal! Really nice clean apartment with apartment with a   lovely, gracious host. I came into the city much later than anticipated due to weather and bad scheduling and she was very patient with me. It's a great location in a cool neighborhood with lots of good food.  Also close to public transportation. Highly recommended!
18523	5234588	41444	2164384	Ari	This is a great little place to stay in New York and Patricia is a great host.  The whole apartment is clean and tidy, the room is comfortable and quite.  I slept soundly through the night which has not always been my experience when visiting New York. Patricia is a super nice host. She was constantly taking care of me; helping me to get around in the city, recommending places to go and things to do and we had some really great conversations.  The apartments location is also very convenient. It is just two blocks from the G train which connects to numerous lines that go into Manhattan. Also you can take the G straight across Brooklyn which can be useful too. The location is great, Greenpoint is a real interesting neighborhood which has the  
18523	5368070	41451	747093	Paolo	She was great and the room much better than it seems in the pics!And the apt is a lovely apt of Greenpoint.
18523	6243897	41491	6926138	Yves	What a Nice place to be thx to Patricia who's really makes me comfortable in her apartment !Don't hesitate this is a great spot near everything and Patricia will take care of you
18523	9331408	41630	9582845	Gloria	Patricia was a perfect host...she is very helpful,nice and lovely person. I have been to her home more than a month and for me it was like being at my home. About the apartment is exactly like the pictures, about the location Greenpoint is a safety place and patricia's house is very near the subway...you can spend almost 30min to Manhattan. I reccomend to everyone this house. Patricia i hope to see you soon :))) 
18523	10246023	41679	10852724	James	Hi Patricia. Really enjoyed my time with you, thank you very much. Was nice to meet you! 
18523	10583463	41695	10703947	Barbara	Thank you for a lovely stay! Everything was easy and uncomplicated. The apartment is lovely! I had a great time and recommend you to stay there!
18523	10789186	41705	4373584	Alison	Thanks for a cozy, convenient, and friendly two-night stay! 
18523	11897667	41747	13143071	Rumeisha	Patricia was very very helpful. It was my first time to NYC and I was alone. I somewhat got lost my first night but she helped me out every step of the way. Thank God for her and the G train. Great host!!!
18523	12220376	41755	3697034	Paolo	Patricia is a perfect host. Room as advertised. Good location.
18523	12471005	41762	11559990	Zen	Great host great room. Nice and cozy apartment in Greenpoint, north of Williamsburg. Very close to the G train lines that run to queens for a transfer across to Manhattan, although the G train does not run as frequently as I would have liked. Otherwise she was a very nice host and the neighborhood was good. Great value.
18523	12755053	41769	1291262	Andy	Patricia was a fantastic host. Great location! Super accomodating and has great advice for activities and things to do. Will book again.
18523	13435315	41786	1656716	Ismael	Patricia is an awesome host!Very nice and helpful with us.The apartment was exactly what we expected and relatively well situated.Very close to the G Subway line so we could get to most of Manhattan in about 30 minutes.We would come back for sure.
18523	13522421	41788	11278453	Neil	Exactly what it says it is -- cozy location in Greenpoint. It met my low-maintenance accommodation needs in every way and was a good value. Patricia is very personable and easy to communicate with. The room is clean and no-frills; the common space is accessible and welcoming to guests. Greenpoint is a very chill neighborhood that's close to everything -- but not so central where it's a constant ****show of tourists and the too-cool-for-school crowd. I would gladly stay here again and definitely recommend it.
18523	13678477	41792	14759862	Apon	I'd recommend this place. Patricia is a great, helpful host. The room is clean and as advertised, but might be a bit too tiny for two if you plan to stay for a period of days.
18523	14688193	41814	1436006	Michaela	Williamsburg is a trendy hipster neighborhood in Brooklyn/NYC, very safe and close to Manhattan! The apartment is located 5 minutes from Greenpoint metro station. Right around the corner there are grocery shops, coffee shops and laundromats and taxis, which makes the stay here very convenient. Patricia is very warm, friendly, welcoming and helpful. I enjoyed my stay here and would definitely come back! 
18523	15074678	41821	26258	Pedro	The listing was accurate with the place. The room is newly painted, however small - welcome to NY. There is no A/C . Patricia was really laid back and easy to get along with, as long as you follow the house rules which are very fair. you can get into Manhattan in less than 30min from here. There are supermarkets and cafes walking distance.
18523	15229210	41825	16245517	Catheline	A nice place to be!  Patricia really makes you comfortable in her apartment ! I will definitively recommend it!
18523	17269932	41861	15138337	Mirelle	Patricia was a great host,  very welcoming and helpful. The room was bright and cozy, as listed, and the apartment was lovely. Easy train ride to Manhattan, and Greenpoint was a very inviting neighborhood, with restaurants,  bars, and grocery stores.
18523	18005109	41871	16702067	Paul	My sister and I stayed at Patricia & Jimmy's apartment for one week in August. It's situated in a quiet neighbourhood, so that we we're able to sleep and relax very well every night. Just around the corner, on Manhattan Av, you'll find little stores and some nice places to eat or grab a drink (The Habitat for example).On your way to Manhattan it's just a 5min walk to the G train, that you'll take towards Court Square. Then it's about 10min to Grand Central, 12 to Times Square with the 7 train . Both are good transfer stations, from where you can either take up- or downtown trains.The apartment is rather small but very comfortable and inviting, as is the room. Next to the fullsize bed you'll find a closet to put your clothes in and the window that faces the patio. Even with the window left open, it's not too loud at night. If you're travelling alone, there's plenty of room. If you're going to stay with someone else, you should know eachother quite well! ; )Patricia was very welcoming when we first got to the apartment, she showed us around and helped us with some tips about the neighbourhood and the transfer to Manhattan. As we took of early in the morning and got home late, we didn't see much of our host. But the few times we met, we had friendly chats and felt very comfortable.We enjoyed our stay at Patricia's and had a very good time there.PS: Make sure you visit Williamsburg, maybe on a Sunday, so everyone will be in the the streets and the parks. It's located just a 20min walk south from your apartment in Green Street. Follow Manhattan Av and you'll get right to McCarren Park, after a short rest you can cross it heading west and find your way to Bedford Av, Home of the Hipster!
18523	18220670	41874	14451710	Fouad	The area was fine, clean host were helpful and easygoing.. I liked the safe area.. however the neihhbor AC was a little bit noisy  at night..
18523	19700477	41898	15298221	Maik	Patricia and Jimmy were really nice. The room was as described and as seen on the pictures. I actually had the feeling, the bed was even a bit bigger than on the pictures. The area was very nice, close to the river from where you can easily take the ferry over to Manhattan.
18523	20098102	41905	16382056	Vincent	Nice appartment, Nice location in Brooklyn. Very close to the G train. Patricia was Nice. :)
18523	21144924	41924	21208183	Renzo	Patricia was an excellent host. Apartment was clean and the location was perfect. 5 min walk from greenpoint g train. Patricia made us feel welcome. Towels were provided and the room was big enough for two people. I recommend Patricia's apartment for anybody looking to stay New York
18523	21416920	41929	4917194	Annina	Nice and comfortable room. Quite centrally located, only a few stops with the subway to Manhattan. 
18523	22025886	41940	21206892	Katharina	I would always stay at this place again. The room was nice and clean, the neighbourhood was good (plenty of shops and restaurants around) and Greenpoint is really close to Manhattan. Besides Jimmy and Patricia were really nice (my plane was late for 4 hours, I arrived in the middle of the night and this was not a problem, thanks guys!). 
18523	22247473	41945	21955926	Yoel	Patricia & Jimmy are great hosts. they are very responsive and did their best to accommodate my schedule. The bed is very comfortable and although I did not use the kitchen, it is well equipped and can facilitate cooking and eating in.Neighborhood is lovely and I felt like a local after a couple of days. lots of nice cafes, good places to eat, diverse crowd on the street and altogether, a very positive atmosphere.  subway access is very good with the G line a couple of blocks away for a fast connection to Manhattan on one end, and Brooklyn neighborhood like Williamsburg and Park Slope on the other end.Thanks for letting me stay in your place!
18523	22462225	41950	8775171	Kim	Patrcia welcomed me warmly and provided all the necessary information. I was arriving late and leaving early so we didn't get to interact much, but Patricia was readily available for all my questions and was also very accommodating to my needs (checking in late and checking out early). The room was perfect for me as solo traveler, but it might be a bit small for two (depending on luggage). The bed was really cosy. I did have some issues waking up  due to the upstairs neighbour making a lot of noise in the middle of the night (not party noise, but walking around, rearranging furniture??) on the first 2 nights of my stay, but putting that aside the stay was pleasurable, it's a quiet and warm place to stay.The location is great, especially if you don't like the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, the G is close by, so close I never got to take the ferry :( The price is great for what the place has to offer and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to enjoy NYC, actually getting out of Manhattan and enjoying other cool places, like the wonderful  Williamsburg closeby. 
18523	22561757	41952	23074746	Sakeinah	Patricia and Jimmy were great to stay with! The room was great and in an awesome location. I would love to stay with them again and I definitely recommend booking with them!
18523	23165516	41967	2410278	Donna	The neighborhood is very quiet here.  Both Patricia and Jimmy are very nice.  
18523	23440814	41974	15400470	Haitham	It was great staying at Patricia's place. She entrusted us with the keys and to checkin since she wasn't at home, and was very nice to prepare two beds for us with enough towels. The place is close to a metro station and a major market street. Recommended if you want to stay away from the Manhattan's hassle.
18523	23646689	41980	23536730	John	Had a great time with Patricia and Jimmy. The room was just as they described. They were super chill and really nice. Would definitely stay with them again. 
18523	24638243	42005	12580962	Jose	Patricia has been a kind, respectful and easygoing host. The apartment is in a good location and the neighborhood is quite and nice. You have the subway line G and the East River Ferry nearly of the apartment. Your best friend will be line express E, which is only two station away in the G line. The bedroom is small, but it's ok. We have spent our best Christmas here. I highly recommend everybody this apartment.
18523	25597016	42024	6657488	Derrick	Patricia was an excellent host during my stay in Brooklyn.  I arrived earlier than expected, and she immediately began preparing the room while I settled into the space.  Friendly, filled with recommendations on where to pick up things I needed or some tasty restaurants.  The room is perfect for those who are looking to explore Greenpoint/Brooklyn area, as it's only a few blocks away from the G train (which will take you all over Brooklyn and into Manhattan quickly).  Sheets were comfortable, room temp was controllable, and she had a Roku for easy use.  Fridge space is ample, and she has all the necessities for cooking some simple meals.Highly recommend Patricia as a hostess!  Thanks for the wonderful stay!
18523	27906749	42077	9244306	Honora	Patricia was a perfect host! The location is wonderful, right in the heart of Greenpoint and close to the metro, great coffee shops and restaurants. The apartment was also very clean -- would definitely stay there again!
18523	28539634	42088	29171112	Sergio	Patricia is very kind, agreeable and likable. The room is comfortable.
18523	29429144	42101	29227586	Stefanie	My boyfriend and I very much enjoyed our stay in  New York. The location of the apartment in Greenpoint was good. Very close to the subway station and I liked the neighborhood even at night i didn't feel very unsafe. It was a good starting point to go to Manhattan as well as South Brooklyn. The room was clean and the sheets were very nice=) Patricia was always open to answering questions if we had any. She did suggest us the best place for breakfast bagels, we went there 3 times in one week.I also liked that our room had a separate lock for which we had our own key. Patricia greater us with a bottle of wine on the nightstand and the day we left, we could leave the room at whatever time was most comfortable for us.
18523	29870256	42107	13952414	Martin	Although we didn't interact a lot because she was away for 2 of the 3 days I spent with my girlfriend in her apartment, Patricia seems like a great host. She managed to scape from work to wait for us and give us a key before the check-in time so we could leave our bags and start enjoying our time in NYC.The apartment and the room are small but nice and clean. The upstairs neighbors are a little noisy but we were so tired after a whole day walking that we had no problem sleeping.The location of the apartment is really convenient and well connected. Although we didn't have any problem, the neighborhood is a little dark at night and I don't know if I would recommend it for a girl alone.Overall our experience was great and Patricia seems like a very nice person.
18523	31519806	42130	29466842	Camille	The flat was as it was in the description on the website. No problem during our stay. Very close tona subway station. We enjoyed our trip to new york ;)
18523	31994001	42136	30979673	Ryan	Room was as advertised and host was very helpful. Would definitely recommend the accommodation to others. 
18523	42654752	42231	26878997	Marissa	I stayed here for the summer (3 months) and had a great time. The room was as advertised and Patricia was friendly and easy to talk to. The apartment was clean and there were never any issues. Patricia even added an AC unit in the bedroom to make the summer heat more bearable. The apartment is a short walk from the G train, which I always found reliable, and it was easy to get into Manhattan. I loved staying in Brooklyn, away from the craziness of Manhattan but not too far away.
18523	44823144	42245	6389470	Seth	Patricia was super nice.  The room has an ac unit which came in very handy during a muggy week.  Patricia was super communicative, didn't have much interaction but when we did it was very pleasant.  Apartment is close to subway and on a cute tree lined street.  
18523	45959336	42254	13159253	Jesi	"Greenpoint, Brooklyn is a gem of a neighbourhood! So glad we stayed here! Patricia's place is right around the corner from coffee shops, bakeries and grocery stores. Plus it's a short CitiBike trip from Williamsburg and great nightlife. Patricia was very welcoming and helpful. Although the place is definitely ""cozy"", it was comfortable, clean, and our room had AC :)"
18523	47618726	42268	31810586	Ben	Patricia was quite nice and presented her apartment to me in a very professional manner. By that I mean, everything was made very clear. There was a space in the refrigerator for my use and all was as it had been made clear in the Airbnb listing. The apartment is one flight up and, although I didn't mind, it might be hard for some folks. The room is smallish, but I only needed it to sleep in and it was quite comfortable. The subway was a just few blocks away. There are lots of restaurants nearby. Also, I was able to find overnight parking on the street - a real plus! 
18523	48739811	42275	30968259	Audrey	Great location close to the metro. Easy to get into Manhattan. I would stay there again!
18523	49224081	42279	35471011	Alison	We had a quick stay of two nights, and had a lovely time at Patricia's apartment. Very clean and Patricia is very friendly. We didn't spend a whole ton of time there, but we did use her TV and roku to watch Netflix in the evening. Really great patio area too!
18523	50003888	42285	3584757	Aimee	Patricia was very accommodating and easy going. The place was clean and located in a good location. Would recommend for a single traveller.
18523	51764947	42301	34463785	Henk	Na een lange reis kwamen we aan bij Patricia. We werden welkom geheten en kregen een rondleiding en uitleg in en over het huis. We voelden ons er thuis, konden onze gang gaan en gaan en staan waar we wilden. Ze woont er wel maar je hebt veel privacy. Het is een goede en veilige buurt. Het metro station is dichtbij. De supermarkt is in de buurt en koffie om de hoek. We hebben het geweldig gehad in New York. 
18523	52236275	42304	5112545	Nathaniel	Great place had a wonderful stay.She was very welcoming and helpful.would definitely stay again 
18523	52937640	42310	41604683	Thomas	Nice, neat and quiet Greenpoint Apartment. Patricia was very helpful and welcoming. Excellent location also which we found very handy!
18523	53827642	42321	1647178	Isaac	Cool location! The house was very organized and Patricia was a great host. I would definitely stay there again! Thank you!
18523	53986550	42323	34991493	Nadine	Patricia was wonderfully inviting without being intrusive.  The room was exactly as describe and organized to maximize the usefulness of the space.  It was a short walk to the metro with lots of local corner stores and restaurants to choose from as well as a Starbucks just in case ;-).  Great value, highly recommend 
18523	56393953	42351	30981286	Richard	Suited my needs perfectly.
18523	57517780	42365	39957319	Oguz	We had a good stay at Patricia's accommodation. It was very clean and cozy. The G-Line is just a few minutes away where you can change to the E-Line which takes 20min to Manhattan. Greenpoint offers enough restaurants and groceries. Thank you Patricia :).
18523	59041466	42375	43142459	Alice	I love the environment here, ppl nice and restaurants just nearby and the subway also, Patricia is so nice, she waited for me at the late night on the first day, and room is clean and lovely just like the pic :)
18523	60749693	42396	12570519	Michael	Apartment was very clean and the host was extremely nice.  I would recommend! 
18523	65204319	42440	16088159	Christopher	patricia was very nice and her place was comfortable, clean and had great sheets on the bed.it is located in a spot in greenpoint.that is walking distance to good food and drink.i will definitely stay at her place again.
18523	66262203	42449	30515139	Ben	Patricia was very friendly and all the details she provided us with were 100% accurate. Hip and convenient neighborhood, nice apartment. 
18523	67949222	42461	8661103	Mare	Pleasant greeting and assistance with luggage. Accurate photos and description of place and what to expect.  Very, very comfortable bed. Patricia gave me a perfect amount of personal space during what was a very exciting/stressful transition into the New York acting world.  Use earplugs if you are mid to light sleeper.  Great proximity to public transpo, Greenpoint nightlife and C-Town around the corner (I was there for 10 days).  Book today!
18523	68494514	42465	4123916	Quentin	Great communication. Patricia is a great host and the room is clean and exactly as expected. I would come back!
18523	69648404	42472	6117719	Miguel	Me and my girlfriend spent a week at Patricia's apartment.Patricia was very friendly, never beeing intrusive with our personal space. The location of the apartment is very good, close to subway,  lots of shops, nice restaurants and bars.The room was as expected and described. Small but nice, organized and confortable.As was the rest of the house, also very welcoming and clean. All went fine.We would reccomend Patricia's place.  
18523	72178792	42491	63780756	Karen	Patricia was a gracious, friendly host, who was both available and unobtrusive. The accommodations were exactly as pictured and described. We found the mattress to be very comfortable, and the apartment was very clean and tidy.This is quintessential NYC living; the tiny bedroom in a small apartment with a tiny bathroom, shared with a housemate, is the trade-off for being in a hip, vibrant neighborhood in one of the world's great cities. The Greenpoint neighborhood  is fun and feels safe at all hours. It is served by the G-Line; take the G two stops northbound  to Court Square in Queens and transfer to the 7 to get to midtown Manhattan.
18523	73900468	42501	149014	Corinne	Patricia's flat is very clean, the location is very convenient close to metro station and to a nice and safe area of Brooklyn. Patricia is a very kind host. I recommend her flat!
18523	77604375	42523	2257794	Mohsen	"Patricia was fully transparent about a minor insect issue (ants, also had a spider in my bed) in the apartment, and while the living area can be a bit muggy during the summer, the room itself is equipped with a loud but powerful A/C unit.  Patricia's apartment is small but is not a horrible place to spend a night or two.   The bed was nice, and the bathroom you share with her is also quite small but gets the job done.  I also wasn't able to use the work desk in her apartment as she was in the middle of a project.  Long story short, I think this is a solid place to spend a few nights in NYC, but honestly if you're thinking of staying long term you could probably look elsewhere and have your money take you further.  Granted, my experience was colored by a situation detailed below:I initially booked 3 months at Patricia's place while interning with a law firm in Manhattan, but was forced to cancel after 10 days because another summer associate desperately needed a roommate given she was in a previously uncomfortable living situation.  Patricia wasn't ecstatic about me leaving early, but I did end up paying her $2,000 for those 10 days including cancellation fees.  I was then given the full introduction to the NYC real estate market when the building I was to move into forbade the sublease at the very last moment.  Because I didn't know anyone in the city, I asked her if I could stay at her place for an additional night and offered to pay her for cleaning and an additional day's rent (in addition to the $2k sum already paid).  She responded with ""you said you knew what you were doing"" and that another guest was coming in a few days and so she ""needed to clean the place.""  I write this not to disparage Patricia's character, but mainly to inform visitors to expect an extremely businesslike experience at her place if intending to stay there for more than a few nights.  I ended up having to sleep on a couch in a not so great part of Brooklyn for a couple of nights, and it would have been nice if I were granted a bit of a helping hand from her given my situation as a young law student new to the city.  Just food for thought.  "
18523	84239930	42557	28467162	Rui	I stayed with Patricia for a month and it was a pleasant experience. Patricia is very responsible, generous, good at communication, and makes great strawberry lemonade:) The list is accurate and the small room has everything you need including an A/C for the hot summer in NYC. The neighborhood is very safe and convenient to everything. The subway is about 5 minutes away. Some grocery stores around here have great products with surprising price. Overall, it's not a five-star hotel, but if you are looking to experience living like a native, this will be a great choice!
18523	87691422	42572	71733240	Haru	It was  very clean, orderly, despite living in the same place that the owner, it's maintained great and has plenty of privacy. 
18523	93724207	42595	42489503	Sofia	Estuve en lo de Patricia una semana con mi novio. El departamento es comodo, simple, la habitacion es un poco pequeÃ±a para poner las valijas, pero el resto todo perfecto. La ducha es muy buena, la cama muy comoda y se puede cerrar la habitacion con llave, que es un plus. La estacion de subte esta muy cerca, cosa que es indispensable para recorrer Nueva York. No la vimos mucho a Patricia ya que saliamos bien temprano y volviamos tarde, teniamos nuestro propio juego de llaves, asi que era super comodo para entrar y salir cuando quisieramos. En general, me parece que es un buen lugar para los viajeros. Volveria!
18523	99538875	42618	12188508	Marcus VinÃ­cius	I had a great experience at Patricia's place. Everything was clean and tidy, the room has enough space and it's very comfortable. Greenpoint is a very nice place, within walking distance of Williamsburg, and there are plenty of options around the apartment. Unfortunately Patricia couldn't be there during my stay, but we could sort everything out really well through distance. If you're going to spend some time in New York City, staying in Brooklyn is a really interesting alternative because you have a better taste of both Brooklyn and Manhattan (since you'll be spending most of the time there anyway) and Patricia's place is a great way to go.
18523	101783791	42628	52686780	Alex	Patricia was nice and communicated very well. Her place was fastidiously clean and we were afforded a lot of privacy. Her apartment is indeed well located and we ended up really liking her neighborhood and being so close to the G train. Would have been hot in the room except that she has a window AC that works very well, so it wasn't. We ended up being comfortable here, for a good price, and say thanks to our host!
18523	102839554	42632	75845681	é¦¨æ?¡	Very clean and comfortable room.Very glad to stay.
18523	104443568	42639	29650785	Tim	"we liked the accomodation. patricia is a nice and caring host. the room is small but adequate and has air condition. the bed is comfortable and fits two people. we were allowed to store our food in the fridge and use the kitchen. the location was great. there are plenty of stores and places to eat on manhattan avenue. youâ??ll get great views on midtown manhattan (terrific sunset) from the ferry terminal at the end of india street (10 to 15 minutes by foot). public transport to manhattan is easy to reach (we used the northbound G-line from greenpoint avenue, 5 minutes by foot, with change at court square; app. 30 minutes to times square ""door to door"")."
18523	105151975	42643	68173848	Agnieszka	Patricia was nice and the accomodation is okay. 
18523	106674434	42650	43214125	Christian-Pascal	Alles war perfekt ! Die Location liegt in einem KÃ¼nstlerviertel mit vielen jungen Menschen. TagsÃ¼ber kann man sich bequem mit der ubahn in den New Yorker Trubel stÃ¼rzen 
18523	108834700	42660	21166293	Robert	Patricia's place was perfect for my stay and Patricia was an accommodating and gracious host. The place was spotless and in a fantastic location. Thanks Patricia!
18523	110184428	42667	36135108	ROGER	Patricia toujours de bonne humeur et disponible nous a laissÃ© toute libertÃ©. Le logement correspond Ã  notre attente, bien situÃ© et calme. Quartier vivant et sÃ©curisant . Nous regrettons que notre anglais n'es pas au top car nous aurions aimÃ© avoir plus d'Ã©changes avec Patricia.
18523	111535671	42674	25703715	Laurence	TrÃ¨s bonne adresse. L'appartement est trÃ¨s bien situÃ© dans un quartier agrÃ©able et prÃ¨s du mÃ©tro. La chambre est petite mais confortable et trÃ¨s calme. 
18523	112757926	42681	26207591	Denise	Super clean, great location and comfortable bed. Close to public transportation and 20-30 minute ride into Manhattan. The neighborhood is safe and close to restaurants and markets. Patricia was a great host!
18523	114075196	42689	97049973	Chris	Patricia was easy to coordinate with and was very hospitable. The location is close to public transit and local restaurants and retail. Excellent spot for traveling in and out of Manhattan.
18523	114828156	42694	10713242	Allison	Great Greenpoint location. Patricia is very nice. I had a great stay! 
18523	115297504	42697	500318	Stephanie	Very nice apartment, wonderful host. Great neighborhood. 
18523	120919298	42716	355606	Ludell And Davis	Patricia was so nice and made us feel very welcome in her home, which she keeps very clean. 
18523	123476572	42733	49709725	Geoff	FANTASTIC FIND - Host was quick to respond, very considerate and gracious, gave guests lots of privacy, & place was in an amazing neighborhood with easy access to subway & lots of great places to eat nearby (& more if you wanted to explore). 
18523	125114078	42738	41499469	Danita	Patricia was very nice and welcoming. Her home was in the cutest neighborhood in Brooklyn. It's about a 20-30 minute ride to Manhattan. There are a few subway stations near the apartment which was nice and convient. There were so many yummy restaurants in the neighborhood you should try. I never felt unsafe there and it was very welcoming. Her apartment is super cute. i would recommend someone to stay here if they don't mind being a little distance for the city. 
18523	137157859	42807	6549175	Mark	Patricia is a good communicator and a gracious host. The accommodations were as described. It is a small room in a small apartment in a convenient part of Brooklyn. Good value. It seems like Green Point is home to many Polish speakers and a large number of Thai restaurants.
18523	139083009	42817	15642353	Audrey	We had a great time during our stay. I defently would recommend this apartment to others.
18523	139750504	42820	17082230	Molly	Patricia was a gracious hostess. I recommend her place.
20200	65007915	42439	53055957	Maika	Charlie non ho avuto modo di conoscerlo personalmente ma mi ha lasciato tutte le istruzioni correttamente per entrare nell appartamento. L'appartamento corrispondeva esattamente a quanto pubblicato nel sito e situato in una zona comoda e vicino alla metro. La zona Ã¨ tranquilla e sicura. 
20200	65788477	42446	48851710	Ferry	Great apartment! The location and the apartment are exactly as described. It is near subway, about 5-10 mins walk. Charlie was very helpful, allowing me to check-in early. Charlie provided clear instructions and was very responsive to all my queries.
20200	66083025	42448	60441830	Quinton	The place was really nice and a great location. We only had to walk a few blocks to get to the train. The building and area was very quiet too. I'm playing my next trip to New York and I'd stay there again. It had all the amenities we needed. 
20200	66877441	42454	13412100	Nigel	Great little NYC apartment, exactly as described. Handy for the subway on Lennox, and restaurants on Frederick Douglass. Charlie and the super, Edwin were very helpful. Would stay here again.
20200	70708582	42479	50831460	Franco	El departamento era justamente el anunciado, muy acogedor y con todas las comodidades que esperÃ¡bamos. El barrio muy tranquilo, seguro, cercano a supermercados, tiendas y farmacias. Charlie siempre estuvo dispuesto a brindarnos informaciÃ³n y orientaciÃ³n, Edwin fue muy servicial, cuando necesitamos de algo nos respondÃ­a de inmediato, lo cual nos hizo sentir cÃ³modos y relajados. Quedamos muy conformes y nos sentimos realmente viviendo en Nueva York, si volviÃ©semos a la ciudad sin duda escogerÃ­amos alojarnos en este departamento nuevamente. 
20200	71758172	42488	47125921	Ed	Although the apartment is relatively small, Charlie has used the space very efficiently meaning that everything needed is there. The neighbourhood is nice and is located conveniently for the subway (3 blocks) and coffee shops/bakeries.
20200	72560504	42493	41966030	Cortney	Absolutely wonderful apartment, right around the corner from the subway. Loved the landlord, he carried my 50 lb suitcase up 3 flights of stairs! Couldnt have asked for a better place, will definitely stay there again when we return!
20200	74317364	42504	9229280	Ã?rkehertug Henrik	Spend 10 days IN NYC and the stay at Charlies was super. Easy to find in a nice neighborhood - the Sub was just around the corner. If you need a place in Harlem - Charlie is you man.
20200	77563841	42522	20760519	Fran	Excellent apt in Harlem. Close to subway stations and lots of stores/restaurants. Charley and the caretaker Edwin were very responsive and quickly resolved any issues we had. Edwin was super kind helping us with our luggage, after going crazy with shopping in NYC!! The apt is exactly as it is shown in the pics. Perfect for a couple or friends travelling together. No complaints at all!!
20200	78704554	42529	33717342	David	Verten mÃ¸tte oss til avtalt tid og vi fikk litt informasjon om leiligheten. OmrÃ¥det var fint og leiligheten lÃ¥ veldig nÃ¦rme offentlig transport.Vi var veldig fornÃ¸yde med nettene vi overnattet her. Aircondition brÃ¥kte noe, ellers var leiligheten perfekt for vÃ¥rt behov. 
20200	81540745	42544	52810002	Kari	The apartment was clean and would be very comfortable for two people.
20200	82604690	42549	29126181	Omar	The room was very cozy and exactly like the pictures. Edwin was amazing and lifted our very heavy bags up multiple flights of stairs. 
20200	96129040	42603	11894456	Olivier	Desappointed, and i'm really surprised, by the previous comments not reflecting the situation. I would not recommend this flat, at all !
20200	101850791	42628	89401067	Stephan	Die Wohnung ist genau richtig fÃ¼r 2 Personen. Sie ist genau so wie auf den Fotos. Alles ist vorhanden, so dass man nichts mitbringen muss. Die Lage ist sehr zentral. Nach 5 Minuten zu FuÃ? ist man an der U-Bahn Linie 3 zum Timea Square. Im viertel fÃ¼hlten wir uns auch sehr sicher. Ungewohnt fÃ¼r deutsche, sitzen viele Anwohner Abends an ihren Hauseingaengen und erzÃ¤hlen. Beim vorbei gehen grÃ¼ssen einige sogar.
20200	103440971	42635	80425207	Georgios	Very friendly host and place, where you felt welcomed and well treated throughout the stay. Conveniently located within walking distance from several subway lines, including express ones. The neighborhood felt safe and there were some stores for late night shopping of essentials. The actual apartment had lots of natural light, it was clean and well equipped. The space could be a bit bigger and the bed and sofa a bit more comfortable for sleeping. All in all, a very decent place to stay while on a trip to New York, pleasant and not too expensive for the city, and conveniently connected to work and touristic locations.
20200	104127353	42638	21376196	Andy	The place was so cozy.  Getting therr was easy and conveniently located near the subway station about 2 blocks away. Had all the things we needed for our stay.  I would recommend this place for anyone that visits nyc city
20200	106341221	42648	87893179	Karim	Nous avons Ã©tÃ© bien accueilli malgrÃ© notre retard.L'appartement est dans un immeuble calme de Harlem, au deuxieme Ã©tage sans ascenseur. Pas de soucis d'insÃ©curitÃ© pendant notre sÃ©jour meme en rentrant Ã  2 h du matin Ã  pied.Le mÃ©tro est Ã  environ 10 mn Ã  pied pour la station la plus proche (Ã  l'ouest) et un peu plus pour la station East. 1h environ de Central Park toujours Ã  pied.Edwin qui etait notre contact a toujours Ã©tÃ© dispo notamment quand internet est tombÃ© en panne le deuxieme jour : pb rÃ©glÃ© en qq heures.L'appartement est comme sur les photos. Ce qui pourrait etre amÃ©liorÃ© est le confort du matelas ( moyen mais ce n'est pas non plus la catastrophe) et l'absence de store vraiment occultant (mais les premiers jours avec le decalage horaire, le reveil est matinal).Fuite du robinet de la douche qui ne derange pas sauf pour le gaspillage d'eau.L'appartement donne sur l'arriÃ¨re donc des jardins.Autrement machine Ã  laver le linge au sous sol.EntrÃ©e dans l'immeuble par digicode donc pratique.Le quartier est agrÃ©able, animÃ©. Appolo theater pas tres loin.Harlem est au nord de Manhattan donc pas central mais les lignes de metro Ã  proximitÃ© de l'appartement permet de rayonner avec des dÃ©lais raisonnables.Donc a conseiller.  
20200	108530448	42659	55818480	Roger	Correcpond Ã  la description
20200	109891645	42666	16482020	Anne	We had a great stay - Charlie was responsive and everything was ready when we got there. The location is was great and was easily able to find a nearby subway station to get around. 
20200	111276720	42673	70016711	Vincent Et Marilyne	"Le logement correspond Ã  la description, le lit est d'un confort satisfaisant sans Ãªtre extraordinaire (grince un peu) et l'Ã©quipement est complet. Le quartier est tranquille, nous sommes rentrÃ©s plusieurs fois aprÃ¨s minuit, sans aucun problÃ¨me. Autre point positif: les mÃ©tros b et c et 1,2,3 Ã  deux niveaux de la 116eme rue sont Ã . 5-10 minutes Ã  pied. L'arrÃªt des lignes a,b,c,d sur la 125 Ã¨me rue est Ã  peine plus loin mais prÃ©sente l'intÃ©rÃªt d'Ãªtre desservi par des trains express qui vous amÃ¨ne Ã  la 53 rue directement, soit Ã  quelques blocks de Times square. Il faut compter environ 3/4 d'heure pour aller au terminus pour aller Ã  Ellis island et la statue de la libertÃ© et autant pour Williamsburg.Enfin,  Edwin le caretaker nous a rÃ©servÃ© un accueil ""friendly"" et nous a dit qu'il nous suffisait de l'appeler en cas de soucis... Mais nous n'en avons eu aucun !En conclusion, nous recommandons ce logement d'un bon rapport qualitÃ© /prix.Thanks Charlie and Edwin,  we had a very pleasant time !"
20200	113692217	42687	84104489	Stacy	This place was perfect! Close to the metro and many yummy restaurants in Harlem. The apartment was perfect Charlie and Edwin were extremely helpful throughout the whole trip! Would definitely recommend Charlie's 4R place.
20200	116007224	42701	102241345	Cion	This place was perfect, for our needs. We needed a place to crash after a long day from the city and this place was the best ! There was parking along the main road and it was a couple blocks from the 2 & 3 train. It was very quiet at night and we had no scares. Edwin was a great help and responded through text within minutes! Check in and check out was hassle free and easy, I would definitely look to stay here for my next possible visit to NYC. 
20200	117030183	42708	40433064	Brittany	Went on a mother daughter trip to NYC. This was a perfect place to stay. Subway is super close and felt comfortable and safe! 
17346	95371911	42601	14039847	Charles	Lisa's place was great. Bright and homey, it was a great home base while in NY. 
17346	97210449	42608	4330162	Gina	Lisa's place is so comfortable, cozy, and clean! She left us the place impeccable and with soft and fresh sheets & towels. There is free street parking right outside and super accessible to Manhattan and many other places. The bed is so comfortable and there is a nice breeze from the park across the street. A very safe and quiet building. Highly recommend Lisa as a host and we will definitely be back! Thank you! 
17346	98122798	42611	25105801	Ed	Perfect location. Great apt. Excellent host. 
17346	100681980	42623	87629453	Michelle	First time to NYC, first time with Airbnb and Lisa helped make it fantastic. Her apartment is cozy, she is friendly and very responsive. The location is really nice, right across the street from a nice park and easy walking distance to multiple dining options. We cooked in a few days and had a great time figuring out the local grocery store. There is this great cuban place down the street that was great fun! Lisa's home was a great landing pad for our adventures. When we need a space again, we will definitely look for Lisa's place to be open.
17346	102872212	42632	28226679	Matthew	Lisa is a host that goes above and beyond! Easy and quick communication, a pleasure to deal with. And when I had a small issue during my trip, she gave me a partial refund completely unprompted. The place is great and amazing gloating next to park and 2 block walk to multiple subway stations.
17346	112031867	42677	25699950	David	This place was great. Super clean and comfortable. The location is fantastic. Lisa was super helpful, and incredibly easy to communicate with. Would stay here again in a heartbeat.
17346	112542368	42680	2505966	Claire	Lisa's apartment was perfect for our weekend stay in NY! Lisa was very communicative throughout the process and the apartment had everything we needed! It's located on the backside of the building so it's very quiet and cozy. The bed was also amazingly comfortable. We would definitely stay here again!
17346	115425049	42698	69548446	Amanda	If you're planning on staying in Brooklyn, you'd do yourself a favor to stay at Lisa's. Located in a great neighborhood, the studio is exactly what my husband and I recently needed when visiting NYC. You can tell that the place has been recently updated and that Lisa works to keep it clean and looking like new!
17346	117039315	42708	40330532	Francine	We couldn't have asked for a better place to stay! Lisa's apartment is cosy, comfortable and pretty.  We felt right at home. Perfect for two, it is located in a great neighborhood, close to the subway, really bike-friendly and right across the street from the park. There are restaurants, coffee shops and bars all nearby. The communication we had with Lisa was great and we were thrilled with our experience overall.  We would happily stay here again if it works for our next trip!
17346	133278681	42787	103161087	Allen	Great apartment (clean/bright) and host (communication timely). Nice location. Thanks 
17346	138605075	42814	69415287	George	great apartment super location wonderful price very efficient communications
13882	232067	40652	468923	Daniel	Elodie's place was great. it was in the perfect location and excellent for the price. the living area / bedroom was spacious. Elodie was great to deal with. She went out of her way to ensure i enjoyed my stay and she met me at the apartment for a very late check in. A five out of five experience for me. I will be sure to  come back on my next visit to the city.
13882	268086	40680	490565	Dana	Our stay at Elodie's place was wonderful. The neighborhood is lovely, the apartment well-appointed and quite enormous by New York standards. She was lovely to work with, and responded very quickly to all of my emails and concerns. 
13882	279184	40687	540215	James	Elodie was a very accommodating host and was always available via by phone or sms. We had a nice time in her place and relative to the cost of  hotels in New York it was great value. The Location was good for accessing  the east village and lower east  side which are both great areas. 
13882	323954	40714	533891	Patrice	Everything was OK. Eleonore is a good host, reliable and taking care that everything will run fine.
13882	380514	40742	568941	Ian	I stayed at Eleonore's place for over a week last August. I had been staying on a friend's boat and traveling for a few weeks before that and it was a great to get to her apartment and have a home base in the city.Overall, the apartment is very nice -- it's rail-road style and very sunny. The sun was one of the things I appreciated most. Yes, this was August, but there was a window a/c and a large fan in the main area, and the apartment has very good ventilation. I lived in dark apartments in NY for a few years and I'll take a sunny apartment any day.Negatives would be the bathroom is very small, it's a hike to transportation, and that the apartment is not renovated.Positives are that the apartment is huge and bright, Eleonore has great taste, the location is very hip, and she is very friendly and kind to deal with.I would stay there again.
13882	402296	40752	696004	Barbara	We just stayed for 10 days at Elodie's apartment. The apartment was great and the living area is very spacious and as described/seen on her pictures. The bathroom is a bit small though, but this was no problem for us.Elodie is  very reliable and easy to communicate with;  quick to respond to any questions. It takes about 15 minutes to walk to the next subway station, although a bus station is just around the corner. Restaurants and bars are also just around the corner. Great location in a very quiet street.
13882	593781	40819	1140918	Clinton And Sharne	Our host, Eleonore, was super prompt with her communications, which gave us great confidence when booking our trip.  Our host's home was lovely and clean and also smelled beautiful!  The location is great - provides a real sense of New York inner city living. While the street is quiet and neighbours really friendly, the general location is filled with exciting little finds. Whether by train, on foot, bike or by cab, this little gem will provide a great little base for your amazing true-NYC experience. We can't wait to come back! ;)
13882	619989	40827	830009	Sina	We stayed a whole week in Elodies apartment. Elodie was the best host we could have wished for. She was easy to communicate with and very helpful. She responded fast before and during our stay. She even called us in Berlin to make sure we got all information. (Thank you again!)The apartment was well equipped. It is not a luxury stay, but you find everything you need. The wifi was fast and the bed was hard but comfortable.  It is good located. You find really nice bars, restaurants and clubs just around the corner. Although there are buses next to the apartment which gets you to the metro or around the city, we sometimes wished that we didn`t had to walk 10 to 15 minutes to the metro-station.The best is that the apartment is absolutely quiet. No street noise and we never really heard the neighbors. We enjoyed staying in Elodies apartment and would recommend it to you.
13882	643029	40834	1029348	Luis	Hi! We stayed one week in Elodies apartment. Elodie is very communicative and you can ask anything and obtain a response very quickly. She sent us a recommendation with all the places to eat in the neighborhood!. The apartment it is really quiet and full of light. The apartment was nice equipped, it is not a luxury, but you have everything to need for a week. The disadvantages are that the apartment it is far away from the metro station but you have 2 bus-lines in the corner, of course, the bus it is a little bite slower than metro but it is fine to see the city. The bathroom it is mini and only for one person and the bed it is hard like a stone. But our conclusion it is that we will come back to the apartment if it possible in our next trip to New York!! 
13882	664068	40841	1245321	Andrei	Eleonore's apartment was a great stay. Check in was smooth, the location was convenient, the apartment was clean and Eleanore was easily contactable. Thanks Eleonore!
13882	1202182	41029	775967	Alex	I had a wonderful time staying in Elodie's apartment for two weeks. Elodie is very kind and communicative, so organizing check-in was no problem at all. Her apartment is in one of the funkiest areas of NYC (in my opinion), with many many interesting cafes, restaurants, bars, and eateries in the area. I work in Soho so on weekdays I caught the Houston street bus, which is just a short walk from the apartment. I'm very grateful to have spent this time in the east village and I would recommend the place to anyone.
13882	1678884	41100	74209	John	Great apartment. Great location. Clean, comfy and bright. I'd definitely stay there again.The German bar round the corner is awesome!
13882	1772644	41112	2881953	Kati	The apartment is great - just as it seems in the photos and description. The neighborhood is nice and quite at night but still very close to good restaurants & bars in both the Lower East Side and East Village. The only downside is the apartment is not located near the subway but the bus picks up right around the corner from the apartment. If you dont mind walkkng or taking the bus, which I didnt, then this is a good place to rent. Elodie is a great host!!! 
13882	1853088	41121	2904359	Ellen	"Hey. We lived in Elodies apartment for 9 days. Over all it was a great experience. When I've been there before, we have been living in more central manhattan. When living a bit more on the outside you felt like a real new yorker. It was a quiet area and we slept very well at night, but the mattress was a bit harsh. It was perfect to eat our breakfast at ""home"" and there is supermarkets round every corner. The only slightly negative is that the subway is a short distance away and at the end of the stay it had been nice to have it handy. But there are buses that goes around the corner. The area has plenty of cool bars and good restaurants. "
13882	1906551	41127	3018432	Tom	Great location, cool apartment and a really good place to stay to get a proper NYC feel. Enjoyed my time here.
13882	3053249	41252	4270799	Sam	You'll find everything where you need it, and if you're traveling alone, this apartment is just the right size (in a New York kind of way.) The place was clean, I never felt unsafe, and she makes you feel very welcome. The place is well-decorated and comfy, for sure.It's totally out of her control, but I should mention that a rooster lives across the street. I'm not sure why, but I definitely wanted to wring it's neck at 4:00 in the morning.
13882	3209803	41275	4272298	Brandi	Great apartment!  It was clean, roomy, lots of windows, and the kitchen had everything we needed.  Yes, it is a long walk to the subway, but we made it work.  Eleonore was great to work with, and she even purchased an air mattress for my son to sleep on!  That is going over and beyond in my opinion!  Would definitely stay here again.
13882	3940596	41362	5368241	Angela	Elodie is by far one of the most wonderful hosts you could ask for. She was easy to get a hold of and extremely fast in her responses. The apartment itself was quite spacious for your typical NYC apartment! The natural light was plentiful and the apartment was extremely clean. It's clear that Elodie puts a lot of work into keeping her apartment a warm, welcoming, and safe place. Some think it might be far from the subway, but the walk every day was pleasant (and it's a great opportunity to take advantage of the bus system as well since several lines were just steps out her door). We were there for just a little over 2 weeks and enjoyed every bit of it all.If you're looking for a place to stay, Elodie's East Village apartment is the way to go! You won't want to leave! Thank you for such an amazing experience! 
13882	4110218	41374	5542627	Erica	This apartment is in a wonderful location, a very spacious and trendy place. We enjoyed our stay, very comfortable and clean for two people, had no difficulties with communication or the organisation of anything. It was our first time using airBnB and a very positive experience Thanks Elodie 
13882	5959843	41478	5629751	Michael	I really enjoyed this flat and the neighbourhood. Very quiet for manhattan. The host was able to accommodate me at the very last minute and stayed in close touch even though she was overseas. Unfortunately the wifi wasn't working but host promise to resolve it. An alternative but weaker connection was available. Tiny washroom, its two flights of stairs up. Very comfortable bed and large fridge. 
13882	6327159	41494	6815169	Francisco	Great place!!
13882	8328468	41573	8301323	Daniela	Good place to stay, good neighborhood and nice host. 
13882	9525224	41640	1241490	Shawn	Elodie's apartment was everything we needed for our stay in the city. It was well-located in the trendy east village and was clean & comfortable. Elodie was also very responsive by email, and our interactions were all extremely positive. Recommended!
13882	10696394	41701	697965	Elodie	Excellent apartment, facilities are working, position is really good (less than 10 minutes from closest subway station) and the area is full of coffees and good restaurants. I'd strongly recommend this apartment to friends!
13882	13323655	41784	15298194	Derrek	Great host with a lovely apartment in charming walk up in alphabet city NYC. Wonderful neighborhood with plenty of good restaurants and places to hang out. Highly recommended if you are in NYC for a few days.
13882	13700197	41792	2514446	Samuel	Les plus : ElÃ©onore a Ã©tÃ© reactive. L'appartement est vraiment d'une taille idÃ©ale, vraiment bien agencÃ© et trÃ¨s calme ! C'est un bonheur de se faire rÃ©veiller par les oiseaux le matin ! Le quartier d'Alphabet city est trÃ¨s sympa.Les moins : Une petite table basse dans le salon serait apprÃ©ciable ;)Contrairement Ã  ce qui est indiquÃ© sur la photo du profil, il n'y a pas de tÃ©lÃ©vision et je pense qu'un petit degrÃ© de propretÃ© en plus serait bÃ©nÃ©fique. Enfin, l'appartement est un peu excentrÃ© du mÃ©tro.
13882	15892255	41837	4723137	David	Elodie was very easy to coordinate with. Her apartment was as described and worked perfectly for our short trip.  The apt was close to all of the places you'd want to explore in the East Village.  The bus stops just steps away and connects you easily to anywhere else you'd like to go.We had a great time and would definitely stay here again!
13882	16309717	41845	17449807	Poyan	Great apartment. Cosy and had all the basic amenities. I know some people complained about the distance to the subway, but I don't think it was an issue. Also, there are a lot of nice bars, small shops and restaurants in the area and the distance gives you the opportunity to explore. I suggest to check out Mighty Quinns and Black Iron Burger for nice food at decent prices.Only negative was that we paid a cleaning fee but the host still wanted us to clean the apartment. 
13882	22477909	41950	16502988	Dina	The bed was very comfortable and the apartment is bigger than seen in the pictures.  Eleonore replied very quickly on email. The neighborhood did not feel very safe. The subway station is about 15 minutes walk. 
13882	23651470	41980	21939219	Kirsty	The perfect place for a couple! We had a great stay in Elodies place, it was very comfortable and cozy. I loved coming home after a long day of exploring NYC. Its not far to walk to the bus stop on 11th and from there you can go in any direction. If you are a coffee drinker I can highly recommend the best coffee just down the road (Ave C) on 9th street. Elodie was very accommodating & responded almost immediately with any questions, this is the first time I have done a airbnb so I really appreciated Elodie being so helpful! 
13882	24559213	42003	10951586	Carolina	Absolutely amazing host and great overall experience. The apartment is just as described - very cute, comfortable, and super clean. Host was easily accessible via text, responding quickly and even letting us check-in early. The neighborhood is quieter than you'd expect in Manhattan while still being close to amazing restaurants and just a short 10-15 minute walk to the train. Fantastic host and a great place to stay. 
13882	25097240	42010	6059777	Dom	The place was good and in a great area with lots of bars and restaurants and a short walk to many great areas.The apartment was tidy, but did not have a professionally clean feel as there was rubbish in the bin and some food still in the fridge.The host was accommodating with our late check-in regarding picking up the keys.There was no TV, however, as pictured.
13882	25391165	42018	25329599	Jose	Nice apartment. Clean, comfy and bright. Nice neighborhood. Eleonore was very friendly. I'd definitely stay there again.
13882	26490657	42049	2175011	Juergen	The perfect place for your stay in NYC. The apt is clean and comfy. Its right in the middle of Alphabet City with a lot of bars and restaurants, but on a very quiet street. Just nice.I would definitely stay at Eleonores place again. 
13882	26876972	42056	26017864	Andrea	Our stay was really nice, the apartment had all the facilities to be comfortable! The subway was kind of far from the house, it was not a big problem our experience was amazing thanks eleonore
13882	34358163	42162	34176895	Liam	Great location. Apartment neat and with lots of space. Quiet at night. Would definitely return. 
13882	35150384	42170	15709836	Maria Teresa	The apartment is not new , but it has everything you need to spend a few days. We ate out a lot. It has everything the description says , no microwave , no TV , no elevator . The bed is very comfortable. Near the apartment are 3 supermarkets and restaurants. The East Village area is very alive during the evening , although the street where the apartment is, is very quiet . It is near subway, line F (2 Ave ) . Also the F , J and Z ( Delanecy ) 10-15 minutes to walk. I recommend visiting in the afternoon, a brewery Mc Sorley 's Old Ale House 7th Street , between 2nd and 3rd Ave.
13882	36807101	42186	18826260	Sebastian	Small but light and airy apartment. Perfect for a few days stay in NY. In Alphabet city so has genuine cross section of the population and makes you feel you are definitely in NYC.Eleonor was nothing but helpful. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to be in the city a few days.
13882	38442820	42200	37540574	Pascal	Une trÃ¨s belle adresse, appartement agrÃ©able et hÃ´te attentionnÃ©e pour rÃ©gler les dÃ©tails d'arrivÃ©e et de dÃ©part.Une adresse intÃ©ressante qui permet de dÃ©couvrir un quartier de NYC plein de vie dÃ©sertÃ© par les touristes
13882	45830947	42253	33131129	Marin	Good Bohemian studio in the Alphabet city, very cosy. The neighborhood is great with lots of restaurants, pubs and delis within walking distance. Eleonore is a great host, makes sure everything goes well
13882	46248272	42255	20943519	Oliver	Perfect apartment with lots of light. Walking distance to Washington & Union Sq parks and 2av subway station. Elenore was very accommodating and always quick to respond. Would definitely recommend.
13882	47106193	42262	3696821	Allisha	Elenore was a great host. The apartment was cute and had everything we needed. She was very responsive to all of my questions. She even checked to make sure everything was ok. The neighborhood was great as well if you love the alphabet city vibe. Also, a great coffee shop on the corner. 
13882	54267121	42325	5911735	John	Eleonore's apartment is lovely: spacious, comfortable, full of natural light, and in a great location. Very glad we stayed here.
13882	55478692	42339	9816661	Francesco	Eleonore even being abroad with hours of time difference was constantly in touch for any need we would have. During the stay she was always very nice checking how it was going. Great host!
13882	55759747	42343	5623905	Clare	A great place to stay to enjoy NYC. The apartment was very quiet at night and easily accessible by bus or taxi, not super close to the subway but not a big problem! The apartment was very cute and the area was great and very interesting! So many bars and restaurants and coffee in easy walking distance. 
13882	74708607	42506	8963707	Zelda	Elenore's eclectic apt is just as described.  Full of light and pretty spacious for a nyc apt.  Great location and despite Elenore being out of town, she was very easy to stay in contact with.
13882	78946568	42531	47780492	Frans	The appartment is located in East Village, a very nice centrally located area in NYC. It has nice bars and affordable great restaurants (try Laguna a few blocks away). Eleonore was not around, but very helpful and clear with the instructions. The appartment itself was OK, but I would say a bit on the expensive side for what is given.
13882	79926769	42536	16648433	Adrian	Great apartment only a block or so away from everything. Eleonore was great and responded quickly with any questions and flexible check in and out
13882	99103041	42616	28159219	Peter	great place, good communication. Myself and partner had a nice stay here for a week in NYC.
13882	99947287	42619	15304323	Elodie	Eleonore is a great host. She was welcoming, communicative and reliable. The flat was spacious, very clean and tidy, and bright. The location is ideal if you want to discover East village and be close to the must see in Manhattan. 
13882	101283397	42625	93742053	Anthony	Great location, easy access to everything. Best price in the area.
13882	122159491	42725	15913718	Laura	Eleonore's apartment is the perfect place to stay if you're interested in exploring the East Village.  Tons of cute Alphabet City restaurants and coffee shops nearby, and the apartment is within walking distance of plenty of public transportation options.  Eleonore was a great host (flexible, easy to reach, organized) and her apartment is super cute and quiet.  As a former resident in the neighborhood, I can vouch for this place as a great find--would highly recommend!
13882	124276335	42736	87014767	Karl	Thank you so much for giving us your place. Exactly what we expected. 15 min walk helped us to digest the delicious food opportunities in NYC. Good communication at all times. Clean and cute. New York Flair all around. Definitely recommend!
15200	77378272	42521	3149823	Carly	Martis was so easy to communicate with and his apartment is clean and beautiful. It's also in the most convenient location for pretty much everything. I highly recommend staying! 
36652	14046576	41800	12962863	Saadia	Thanks so much to Vember. We had an awesome time in her lovely flat. The bed is incredibly comfortable, the shower is excellent and it's in a perfect location close to the subway and a few mins from the riverside. I can't recommend it enough. Also Vember gave us some fab restaurant recommendations and was really responsive throughout. 
36652	14304950	41806	8394531	Carla	Vember was very helpful and got back to me right away whenever I had questions. The location is great! Great neigborhood, close to transportation, and safe. The place is just as it looks on the photo. Very clean, stylish and incredibly comfortable. I loved it and would stay here again!!  Thanks Vember!
36652	15377676	41827	2549936	Douglas	Vember was an incredible host - she was extremely flexible with respect to check-in/out and very kind throughout the whole stay. She checked in a couple times to make sure everything was ok, and she even left us a bottle of wine. Very special stay.
36652	16363017	41846	211343	Bo	Vember was a wonderful host. Everything went seamlessly. She even left us rose and gin and tonics! The apartment was just as in the pictures, clean and cute. Doormen are super friendly as well. Tons of great restaurants around and a block from the water. However, If you are a light sleeper, which i am,  you might have to bring earplugs. Other than that it was a great stay and would recommend to others.
36652	17106079	41858	8209786	Rachel	A perfect west village apartment in a location that you could easily walk where you needed but still be a little tucked away and quiet. Clean comfortable and extremely spacious for a studio, we loved all the quality details in Vembers apartment that made it feel like home. Would definitely stay again! 
36652	104130682	42638	2259362	Christopher	Lovely apartment. Very airy. Lots of light. Quiet enough but close enough to lots of things to do.
36652	108982060	42661	29475027	Sarine	One of the best Airbnb experiences we've had! The minute we stepped into Vember's studio we felt at home. It was cozy with stunning mid century decor, bright with beautiful details and quite spacious for the two of us. The freshly cut flowers in the room were a special touch. Vember was an incredible host. Although we didn't meet, she was always very quick with responses and provided the help we required along with a list of recommended spots (which she added to each time she thought of others). She also provided all the amenities we could have asked for, was very generous with everything in her home including a steamer, a bottle of wine on arrival, use of the laundry in the building, hangers and closet space for our clothes. We really felt like we were staying at a friend's home. The location itself is in a perfect spot in West Village, surrounded by bars, restaurants, boutique stores, markets, parks and more. Walking on the Pier by the Hudson River was spectacular at sunset and only a block away. It was truly a magnificent experience living like locals in one of the cities most beautiful areas. I highly recommend Vember's Studio and would stay at her place again. A lovely lady with a beautiful home. Fantastic experience!!!    
31328	53295737	42315	7796924	Grace	Prashanth was an excellent host! And his apartment was in a perfect location, right above Time Square and a walk away from all the tourist attractions and hidden gems. His room mate was very hospitable, friendly and easy to talk to as well. He even offered a wide range of places to go to around Time Square and gave us lots of tips for buying tickets and getting around the city. Prashanth as a host was fantastic, and although he was on a business trip, he made sure to check on us to see if we had all that we needed, which was very reassuring. They have great amenities and are very generous, Prashanth even left energy bars and chocolate bars for us on our stay which was very sweet. Overall a good stay and would recommend it for a traveler who is keen to stay in a great location with nice and knowledgable guys! Thanks again Prashanth 
31328	55671423	42342	48458995	Hemanshi	This was the first time that I used Airbnb and I was really skeptical at first but after speaking with Prashanth I felt very comfortable. Post confirming with him, he stayed in touch and was very helpful with all the questions I had. He was not present at the time of my arrival but was very helpful even when he was not around. I met with his room mate at first, Vaibhav, who was also very sweet and welcoming. The house was comfortable and cozy, I had my privacy when ever needed. The house is located in the center so everything was walking distance. Prashanth had provided me with a blanket, welcoming snacks and an extra heater. When he was in New York he did make it a point to spend some time and take me out which was very sweet. My stay over all was very comfortable, would highly recommend this place and host. 
31328	100688456	42623	92520922	Ami	
31328	102268418	42630	14564248	Monica	The apartment has excellent location, 5 minutes walking you get to Times Square and the subway is a few steps. The place description is correct, as seen in the publication. The neighborhood is really nice, busy with several dining options, shopping, theaters and sometimes a little bit noisy because you are in the middle of everything!The bedroom is cozy and the bed is comfy, you have the basics for a good stay, clean sheets and towels, iron available and good size bathroom with enough hot water to relax and rest after touring the city.I didn't meet personally Prashanth because he's on travel, but he and his roommate were friendly and pending of our stay would be pleasant, we made a special request and they supported us immediately, we actually had a very good experience in New York, thank you.
31328	104951559	42642	93446578	Vishal	The host was always around to provide all help. The location was fantastic and very safe. Room was clean, airy and comfortable 
31328	106153826	42647	20451433	Vanessa E Leonardo	A localizaÃ§Ã£o Ã© excelente, vocÃª fica bem no centro do coraÃ§Ã£o de NY. Podendo fazer praticamente tudo a pÃ©, a dois passos da Times Square. O Vaibhav o companheiro de quarto foi que coordenou tudo, pois o anfitriÃ£o estava viajando, ele foi muito cordial e acessÃ­vel.O quarto Ã© alugado durante a ausÃªncia do anfitriÃ£o, nÃ£o Ã© preparado para receber hospedes, nÃ£o possui roupa de cama para cada hospede, nossas roupas de cama estavam usadas (cabelos e sujeira nos travesseiros e lenÃ§Ã³is). As fotos do anÃºncio nÃ£o sÃ£o igual a realidade, NÃ£o houve limpeza adequada no quarto. Para agendar a limpeza vocÃª precisa estar no local, logo perde tempo de sua viagem. Reclamamos com o anfitriÃ£o e seu companheiro de quarto e eles agendaram uma nova limpeza apÃ³s a nossa primeira noite, porÃ©m as roupas de cama nÃ£o foram trocadas pois nÃ£o haviam outras. No final o valor pago foi apenas pela localizaÃ§Ã£o. O apartamento tem tudo para ser excelente, porÃ©m precisa de limpeza, clareza no anuncio e de adaptaÃ§Ã£o para receber os hospedes do airbnb.
16069	62775734	42416	50391200	Danielle	Had a great time with family at Jessica's home. We had the entire first floor with four bedrooms which comfortably fit all of us. We were experiencing negative temperature weather throughout our stay and the host was nice enough to provide 3 additional space heaters just in case we needed them! On the first night we cooked a big meal- everything in the kitchen down to the utensils was spotless! Another thing that was key was having two bathrooms and two showers. With the number of people we had, this was huge. The host was very responsive via and in touch whenever we needed anything. I'd definitely recommend staying here to anyone considering!
16069	66595368	42452	62460241	Magali	We truly felt comfortable most of the time. Jessica was checking on us before we arrived and during are staying in NY. It is exactly how it shows on the pictures. We enjoyed the walk to the subway because its close to the main street and its diversity is out of this world. We will be coming back and stay longer and will rent the house again. 
16069	67627184	42459	57809887	Ishtiaq	Jessica was very friendly and very helpful. she took care of us as her own guest. The neighborhood was very nice and secured. Subway was only 5 mins away. Very convenient. Spacious house. Very neat and clean. Everyone likes this house. .. thank you Jessica for everything u did. Hope will see you again. ... :)
16069	75702858	42512	19039449	James	Jessica did a great job making us feel right at home. Throughout the trip she communicated well. The apartment was exactly as it was described. All the bedrooms allowed us to have everyone stay in the same place, and the bathrooms made it very manageable. The place is very clean! The kitchen has the necessary items for cooking and the full fridge will store your food/snacks. Thank you Jessica!
16069	79489790	42534	13579820	John	"Jessica appears tobe sincere host & were prompt in responses initially. However, she actually not happy to answer your queries as she revealed when she was angry with us later. If you do not reply her as promptly she seems mad through her text msg.Firstly, do note she is not the owner and all requirements has to go through her to the host before it gets one. (not sure if this is a violation of Airbnb TnCs). We were greeted by a man and not Jessica when we arrived so we are not sure if its the correct apartment.!? And there is no unit number on the house or gate so you won't know if its the right one.Then the apartment do not have total climate control - as they were unwilling to turn on heater during summer, even if its preferred.Take note that Jessica require you to clean up the house, bring out the trash even when you paid for cleaning fees. When you asked why this was so, she bluntly tells you ""Hey this is airbnb, not a hotel"". The actual owner, Ms. Harris and her hubby were actually friendly people.This is the first.time staying at an Airbnb were we told to clear all our 4 days trash!!!Judge for yourself if you want to deal with this ""host""."
16069	80590551	42540	27113887	Tonnisca	Nice house in a great neighborhood. In walk distance of the  metro and and with the unlimited ride metrocard we saw a lot of wonderful New York. Jessica is very friendly (like all NY-erks we met) and helpful. 
16069	82050843	42547	40696901	Kevin	Thx!  All good
16069	83435312	42554	70871407	Carol	The listing was accurate, we got what we expected. Location was good, close to subway, easy ride to Manhatten, quiet. to find a house that slept 8 was great and the price made a trip to NY affordable. not fancy, but clean, welcoming and exactly as described and perfect for 2 families. 
16069	84110389	42556	23880487	Rocky	BEST HOST EVER! invited us to go to a Brooklyn rooftop to see the 4th July fireworks, amazing!always helpful, prompt responsebeautiful house in a friendly neighborhood, yes it's located in Africa America area, but they are nice and fun, invited us to their house party.great place to stay in New York! will come again
16069	87169542	42569	77498954	Terry	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

16069	91327853	42586	9818083	Ivan	Very spacious house. It is a great spot for a family because all rooms have at least queen or full beds. There are ceiling fans and TVs in all rooms. Close to subway, target nearby and several deli stores. The neighborhood doesn't seem very safe although Flatbush ave seemed fine. It's the last stop on the subway so allow yourself approximately 45 min to reach certain spots in Manhattan. The apartment is a bit old and the furniture could use some renovation. Jessica was very prompt and helpful when I needed to contact her. Efficient host. 
16069	94140288	42596	60225222	Muz	Very easy check in. Jessica communicated consistently and provided follow ups to make sure we had everything we needed. She is an outstanding host, we would definitely stay again.
16069	103442882	42635	35241797	Kasia	Easy check in. House is located close to the last metro station in Brooklyn (approximately 10mins) but the neighborhood didn't seem to be very safe. Be prepared to spend around 1 hour in the metro to reach Manhattan. Apartment is spacious, four bedrooms with queen beds. Not many kitchenware if you decided to cook. The space could use some renovation. During our stay we faced one problem: no internet connection due to the fact owners changed the operator few days before our arrival and there was no access to wifi. This was solved after four days since I contacted Jessica. She was helpful host though, but I think as she is not the owner everything takes more time. 
16069	107193655	42652	96430443	Christine	The house was great for the seven people in our group. Very spacious and as described. Jessica kept in contact with us from beginning to end. We didn't have any problems with the area the house is in, and there are plenty of stores that are close by and the subway all within walking distance. Having a kitchen came in handy for us too so we really appreciated having full use of that.
16069	111636582	42675	73784309	Joel	Jessica made us feel very welcomed. We slept well and for the most part enjoyed our stay. There was a mix up and miscommunication between Jessica and the owner. So we ran into some issues. But after talking with the owner, I'm sure those issues will be taken care of. Thank you for letting us stay in your home.
16069	124730670	42737	107087194	Abhishek	Jessica was a super communicative host, and made check-in easy by using a number lock to access the keys and checking in later than noted. The rooms and apartment were clean, and the kitchen was sufficiently stocked.The house itself is 5 min from the subway station, but being at the end of the subway line, traveling to and from the apartment to Manhattan took a while. But the reality is that the MTA being what it is, travel anywhere in NYC takes a while. Bring a book and enjoy a good read without worrying about missing your stop!However, that said, the location served useful for NYE because the house is a couple stops away from prospect park, and goes in the opposite direction to Manhattan! As a result, traveling back after fireworks was an easy commute. Definitely recommended for especially crowded events!
36259	109158510	42662	43647019	Stephen	The host canceled this reservation 2 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
36259	121871139	42723	39385846	Beatriz	Perfect location, easy parking on the weekend. 
36259	122712844	42729	2130218	Phil	Quiet, clean, comfortable and close to thee action. Never met Ryan, cos of the holidays. But everything was smoothly organized. Thx. 
36259	124301557	42736	31104688	Gabriela	Loved staying at Ryan's place!Great location, very clean, few minutes from subway, restaurants and Magnolia bakery (which is awesome, if you stay you must go) It's a very comfortable apartment, we were 6 and slept great! Just like the pictures! Even though we didn't get to meet Ryan, he answered very quickly every time. Great experience!  
36259	125579194	42741	64281492	Rosanne	The Host reached out both before we arrived and during our stay - to make sure we were comfortable and ready to take any requests if we needed anything.  The online description was perfect - the unit IS an Amazing 2 bedroom apartment for the price, has been completely upgraded, has internet access, all bedding, linens, dishes, etc., is very clean, with a  galley kitchen featuring a refrigerator and dishwasher, located toward the rear of the building and is quiet and comfortable.  I HIGHLY recommend this convenient Greenwich Village location - but then I'm partial to staying in the Village when my family visits NYC. You REALLY can't beat the price for the amenities, location and security this rental offers!!!
36259	125965134	42743	106946125	Heather	I stayed here over the weekend with my husband and another couple.  We had a great time!  Ryan provided plenty of restaurant/bar suggestions and was very easy to communicate with.  The apartment was perfect!  Great location!  Size was great for 2 couples.  It was also very clean.  We will be back!
36259	132389411	42783	13586446	Brenda	Perfect place to stay we were able to get around the city very easily and great neighborhood.
14409	147758	40513	278755	Ali	We loved staying at Ori and Sivan's place in the East village. You couldn't ask for a better location especially if you love restaurants and culture. Erdi the cat was lovely, we really got used to staying here and wished we had more time. The apartment is airy, spacious and clean and Ori was really helpful when it came to household logistics. Can't wait to get back there one day soon. Thanks Ori and Sivan, Ali.
14409	222821	40644	412922	CÃ©cile	Ori's and Sivan's place is the best ever to enjoy New York and East Village! The neighborhood is lovely, sunny, with a lot of places to eat or to walk. And it's in Central New York within a walking distance from Soho, Tribeca and Meatpacking!The place makes you feel like a real New Yorker! Very clean and fashion loft which is sunny, comfortable, with a great kitchen and a lovely terrace to enjoy as soon as the sun comes up! And we had a very nice contact with the hosts through email! Very nice and confident people!We couldn't hope for much and we will probably come back soon!
14409	579912	40815	490654	El	Ori and Sivan where a pleasure to deal with. The apartment was exactly as described and we would come back in a heartbeat. Clean, spacious, great location - a rare jewel in NYC. Erdi the cat was charming and the locals in the neighbourhood were wonderful. Thank You for making our stay in NYC an experience we will not forget.
14409	895505	40940	619577	Camilla	Ori's place was fantastic. We couldn't have asked for a better location and the apartment had everything we needed. We would definitely stay there again.
14409	1199165	41029	1353637	Brendan	Ori's place was so well set up and totally suited our needs. The place is spacious, clean, light filled and has a fantastic outdoor balcony that is great to spend time in on a sunny day.This was our first time in New York and Ori provided us with a lot of invaluable information about the local area, and tips on good places to eat, drink, etc.This place is amazing value for its location and setup, and getting to know Erdi the cat was one of the highlights of our stay.When we visit NYC again we'll definitely look at staying at Ori's place.Brendan and Consuelo.  
14409	1233337	41035	435855	Stefano	Ori 's apartment is in a very nice and central location. Arounf the building lota of restaurants, bars, easy for subway!The terrace is lovey as you can have breackfast in quiet back side...much better if you have a sunny day!I will come back to Ori's place and I will suggest this property!Erdi, the cat is lovely, friendly and indipendent!
14409	3006051	41245	3401007	Camille	We had a fabulous time staying at Ori's apartment - there was so much going on around St Marks Place and the East Village, many quirky outlets, restaurants and bars to check out. The place is a few blocks to the nearest subway, and also an easy walk to Union Sq where there were more lines running through. Ori's apartment is extremely spacious, appears as in the photos. We didn't get to enjoy much time on the patio though, as weather was getting colder. Erdi the cat is a fine companion, very entertaining and warm with strangers - we had no trouble at all staying with him at the apartment. Would highly recommend staying here and would love to be back the next time we visit. 
14409	3049268	41252	3265325	Claire	Just like the pictures, just like the description, couldn't get any better to be honest. We loved staying there and thought the location was perfect. Ori was easy to contact and instructions very clear and easy to follow. And Erdi the cat was an added bonus in the holiday!Thanks guys, we had the best time and would come back any day and of course recommend :)
14409	3601097	41327	4133692	Elysia	Ori and his wife were great! Erdi the cat was adorable and very sweet. Their place was well located, clean, spacious, and modern. They were incredibly helpful with letting me know what was in the neighborhood. I very much look forward to staying with them again, it was a great experience!
14409	3675510	41336	4609672	Hilde	The apartment was great, as expected, it was nice and spacious and  everything worked as it should. The area is very charming with the spesialized shops, the variety of great and affordable restaurants and cafes. We, a mother and a teenage daughter, espescially enjoyed the oppurtunities for Vintage shopping in the area, and also it is very convenient to have only one stop to go with the subway to Williamsburg. The cat is very cute and people-friendly and entertaining. It is nice to have the oppurtunity to walk to many of the attractions of Lower Manhattan. WE recommend the apartment, and would love to stay there again!
14409	3735591	41343	4600465	Nicola	What a great apartment in a fantastic location! The apartments is true to the pictures and in a perfect location for the subway, funky restaurants and vintage stores. Ori was very accommodating and helpful. This was our first Airbnb experience and we are happy to say it is unlikely we will stay in a hotel again. Experience New York like a local!
14409	4115766	41375	4579681	Katie	We couldn't have asked for a better experience on our first visit to New York. Ori was extremely helpful throughout; the apartment is beautiful and in a perfect location for exploring the city. The only problem was that my heart broke a little when I had to say goodbye to Erdi. Warning: you will fall in love with this cat. 
14409	4135735	41377	4794941	Mary	Ori's place was just lovely, loads of light and really quiet and a really good size for an NY studio! Excellent location with plenty of good bars and restaurants nearby and in adjacent neighbourhoods.  Erdi the cat, was also a great host, always welcoming after a hard day of sight seeing and very well behaved. Such a treat to have outside space and enough room in the apt to make dinner, eat at a proper table and lounge on a very comfy sofa! The shower was also really good and powerful which anyone with long hair knows, is such a luxury!Ori was also very communicative and despite not actually being there, was very hospitable and generous and we had no problems getting into the apartment.All in all couldn't have had a better stay and would def recommend staying here for cat-lovers!
14409	5176075	41442	5437375	Jerome	Perfect communication (Ori), lovely studio (light, quietness, deck) and great location (Saint Mark's Place). Would definitely stay there again.
14409	5455625	41456	2279212	Kevin	The place was great and exactly like the photos. You cannot beat the area either. We walked almost everywhere food and shopping.
14409	5983946	41480	6572713	Julie	The apartment was just like the pictures: great! Everything worked well. We really appreciated the air conditioning, the bed was very comfortable. And the neighborhood was very nice: restaurants, grocery stores.. but very quiet at night. I would love to come back! The perfect place in the perfect area!
14409	6126267	41486	6062801	Laurel	Ori's loft is perfect. It is exactly as it appears in the photos and is very spacious, well designed and clean. The kitchen and bath are newly remodeled and efficient as well. We found it to be in a perfect location in the city. It's in a hopping part of the East Village and if you love incredible food, coffee, cocktails and funky shops like we do, you'll love it as well. It's also close to many subway lines and easily walkable to many other areas of town. We hope to be back next year.
14409	6365182	41496	6149797	Irena	We really enjoyed our stay. The apartment was clean and exactly as pictured. The location is excellent. Also, we very much appreciated the quick and easy communication with Ori. I would highly recommend staying here and I would stay here again myself.
14409	6750618	41510	5581377	Rebecca	The apartment is in a fabulous location in the heart of the East Village, by far our favourite neighbourhood in NYC. Close to multiple subway stops, great restaurants & coffee shops (don't miss I Am Coffee). Ori sent us a list of his favourite local places which was really helpful, and both Ori and his friend Lydia who let us in were really quick to respond to our enquiries. The apartment is huge and well equipped and is exactly as it appears in the photos. Thanks Ori for having us to stay 
14409	7980266	41558	7713356	Lut	This appartment is even better, larger and nicer than on the pictures. So spacious, so nicely decorated, much more than you would ever imagine. Perfect place for your visit to NYC. Very smooth and quick communication with Ori, although he and his wife weren't around during my stay. For anyone planning a trip to NYC, do check the availability of this place! I definitively recommend it, and if I come back, I hope I can stay in this place again.
14409	8129526	41564	6303530	Deborah	This apartment is in an excellent, very buzzy neighbourhood with lots of interesting cafÃ©s, bars and shops. 5-10 minute walk to 3 diff subway lines and walking distance to some of the most interesting parts of New York , it would be hard to be better located. The facilities are great; plenty of space, comfortable bed, excellent shower , well-equipped kitchen (though so many eating out options we didn't use it much), and lovely having the outdoor deck. Got pretty noisy on weekend nights but all part of the experience and quiet in the mornings! We didn't meet Ori but his friend Lydia (an Australian!) was very welcoming and all communication went smoothly. We especially appreciated the recommendations for coffee and eating out. We loved our first stay in New York and would definitely return to Ori's place if we could. 
14409	8291160	41571	6464933	Christopher	Bang in the East Village, Ori's apartment provides a perfect sanctuary, and the best base for sorties across Manhattan, Brooklyn and out to Coney Island and Brighton Beach. Lydia, Ori's representative on Manhattan is more than willing to offer help (should help be needed),  and the delightful Cathy keeps the apartment spic and span. Any caveats? No, not really. The apartment is as advertised and photographed; the terrace is an absolute boon for those of us that smoke. We breakfasted at Bluebird down on East 1st Street, we dined at Prune on the same street, we drank at the Kingston Hall on 2nd Avenue; all within strolling distance â?? it was as if we were living in New York. We were both Airbnb virgins before this trip, and were delighted with the experience. 
14409	8727090	41592	7789920	Jerry	Ori's place had everything we needed, a great location, and I mean a great location. Close to everything. The place is specious and very comfortable, equipped with everything needed. The wifi was fast and reliable. We did not get to meet ori, however he was very fast on replying when we needs to ask something. We had a fantastic time In NYC, and was awesome to have a space that we can escape to when we needed. I already recommended the place to few friends that are planning to visit. And i will definitely check the place in my next visit. Thanks for sharing your place ori ;)
14409	8931184	41604	8594580	Rhiannon	This was my first experience using Airbnb and I hope they are all like this. The location and this apartment was AMAZING, as was host Ori - he made the process very simple and easy and provided lots of information about the apartment and area. He was very quick to get back to us on a couple of questions and was so helpful it really made our holiday all the more amazing. The location of his apartment is perfect, close to everything (that pizza place on the corner is perfect when coming home from the bars down the road) and the apartment was beautiful, clean, modern. Thank you!
14409	9078652	41613	7993464	Mariam	From Jess: lovely spacious apartment that is just as good (if not better) than it looks in the photos. also in a great part of new york - close to subway, great food, drinking spots and shops. perfect place!Myself: This place was absolutely amazing! We didn't realise how well-situated the place was in terms of subway, entertainment and food! Ori left us with a list of places to go visit on our stay and they were all delightful. Definitely visit Abraco as it had fabulous coffee! The house was clean and tidy, it had a lovely user-friendly kitchen and bathroom with a modern clean finish. The only downside was the place can get a little hot after a day of adventuring however, it was definitely the least of our worries. Better it be warm than freezing! The location is fantastic and the price we paid was definitely worth every cent. I can't wait to visit East Village again and stay in this beautiful abode! 
14409	9458597	41638	5885065	Jo	Ori's apartment is exactly as advertised. It's is in a great area in the east village. The kitchen is user friendly and bathroom clean and neat. Hand over of keys etc was all very smooth and we had a great time.Fantastic choice of apartment!
14409	9848329	41653	12673	Kirsten	The loft is great especially if you are a fan of the East Village in Manhattan.  Very spacious and very clean.  Looks exactly like the photos.  My communication with Ori was easy and prompt.   Overall this was a great transaction and terrific place to stay and I recommend it highly.  I hope to stay here again soon.  
14409	9953365	41660	10480441	Megan	Ori's apartment in East Village is in great position for exploring the lower half of Manhattan on foot. It is also well positioned for many bar, restuarants & anything else you need. Ori also gave us some good suggestions for places to eat.The apartment was comfortable & warm (essential in January) with everything we needed. The terrace is a bonus especially for smokers & to check the weather each day. would be even better in warmer weather. We had a great stay
14409	10191753	41675	2099658	Darius	We loved our stay at Ori's apartment in the East Village. The apartment is spacious (the pictures are a very good representation) and in a great location with many nice bars and restaurants. Communication with Ori was very easy and he made it very easy for us and provided a lot of good advice as well. We are already looking forward to staying at his apartment again on our next trip to New York.
14409	10259977	41680	7091744	Ashley	Ori is awesome and so is this apartment! I will definitely stay here again the next time I visit NYC. It's very true to the photos, very clean and in great proximity to all bars and restaurants. I would without a doubt recommend this apartment.
14409	11124231	41720	8529572	Jo	Ori's apartment was perfect for our time in NYC. We stayed for 11 nights in March and it was incredibly convenient- close to a number of subway stops as well as. loads of restaurants and cafÃ©s. The apartment looks just as it does in the photos and was clean and comfortable. Ori was really helpful and responded quickly to emails and questions. He also provided a great recommendations to the area. His friend lydia was lovely and met us late at night to show us the apartment when we first arrived. I would definitely recommend staying here and would stay here again if back in NYC. 
14409	11218169	41723	8815147	Mary	My boyfriend and I stayed at Ori's place in the east village on our trip to visit my sister in NYC.  Absolutely perfect location.  Quiet, bright, clean apartment on a great street.  Close to tons of places to eat, drink and get coffee and super easy to get to other areas of the city.  Ori was super helpful in suggestions of places to visit in the neighborhood.  And it was so great to have a deck in the middle of the city!  We would definitely stay here again :) 
14409	11318007	41728	10332000	AmÃ©lie	Great time in New York and perfect appartment to enjoy the city. Very happy with our first airbnb experience!! Host very available, good contact and advices! Thanks
14409	11446503	41732	3541535	Sean	We had a great time staying at ori's place. St marks is an interesting eclectic area, with interesting shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood. We are at some iof the places ori recommended. Apartment was spacious and clean. Definitely recommended 
14409	11705685	41742	9777566	Kelly	We loved this apartment! It was so much bigger than we expected and such a pleasure to spend time in. The neighborhood was unbeatable--we walked nearly every where in Lower Manhattan--and there a couple of subway stops quite close by as well. The apartment was comfortable, clean and the deck was gorgeous. We were truly sad to leave. It really helped make our experience in NYC feel authentic. Ori gave us a really detailed and helpful manual prior to our arrival so we had a good idea of where to go for some good meals, coffee, etc. It really was a delight and we will definitely stay here if we are back in New York! We are still pining over it...Thank you Ori!
14409	11911106	41748	102426	Conny	We enjoyed our stay here very much. The apartment is very comfortable and spacious. Excellent location. The host was very helpful and responded quickly to our inquiry. Definitely recommended!
14409	12363477	41759	1366989	Cecilia	Ori's apartment is great! very big and full of light. the location is very good too, there are lot's of bars and restaurants at a walking distance.I recommend you to stay here and would definitely return!
14409	12772057	41770	1255526	Belen	Pasamos unos dias INCREIBLES en el departamento de Ori.Todo es exactamente igual a las fotos. El lugar es amplio y bien iluminado!No usamos la terraza con asador porque el clima no nos acompaÃ±Ã³ mucho pero es ideal para desayunar o comer algo rico y descansar.El baÃ±o y la cocina estan totalmente renovados. La cocina es muy cÃ³moda y estÃ¡ muy bien equipada.La ubicaciÃ³n en East Village es perfecta para recorrer todo Nueva York y tiene miles de bares y restaurantes para recorrer. La verdad es que recomendarÃ­a el departamento para cualquier pareja que quiera pasar unos dÃ­as y sentirse como en casa.Gracias por todo Ori! Nos hubiera gustado conocerte!Con Lydia estuvo todo perfecto y se preocupÃ³ por entregarnos las llaves a los 10 minutos de haber llegado aunque nosotros no le avisamos con anticipaciÃ³n que estabamos allÃ­. Gracias Lydia! :)
14409	13204936	41781	4407043	Michael	Ori's appartment was great : very good location (close of many restaurants and bars, not very far from several subway stations), spacious and very well equipped. We had a very good time there. I definitely recommend this flat. 
14409	13777358	41794	9458128	Nina	Nachdem unsere Ankunft in New York City sehr turbulent ablief, waren wir sehr erleichtert, als wir in Ori's Apartment ankamen. Es war wirklich sehr groÃ?, hell und modern eingerichtet mit neuem Bad und neuer KÃ¼che, sodass wir uns sofort wohlfÃ¼hlten! Das Apartment entsprach den eingestellten Fotos und Ã¼bertraf sogar unsere Erwartungen. Im Haus waren alle sehr nett zu uns und auch Lydia, der Ersatzkontakt (Ori war auÃ?er Landes,) war ebenfalls sehr hilfsbereit und immer schnell via (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) zu erreichen.Die Gegend um den St. Marks Place hat uns sehr gut gefallen. Gut war auch, dass der Partytrubel nicht direkt unter den Fenstern des Apartments stattfand, sodass man nachts gut schlafen konnte. CafÃ©s, Bars, Restaurants, Apotheken und kleine SupermÃ¤rkte, sowie diverse U-Bahn-Stationen waren zu FuÃ? zu erreichen. Ori hatte im Vorfeld auch eine lange Email voller Tips an uns verschickt.Kurz: die Wohnung war so cool, dass wir ab und zu sogar mittags wiederkamen um dort etwas zu essen und zu verschnaufen.Wir wÃ¼rden das Apartment sofort wieder buchen!Thanks again, Ori!
14409	14260689	41806	10943610	Boaz	We enjoyed staying in the apr. Great neighborhood â?? the location is just in the heart of it all. Very close to major subway stations. Keep in mind that because of this it can get pretty noisy mainly on weekends. There are many good restaurants nearby. You will have to climb up 2 stairways up in the lack of an elevator and those stairs are quite steep. The place is in very good condition. Bathroom and kitchen completely renovated. Walking on the wooden floor is very noisy. Last thing that did disturb us is to much sunlight early morning â?? for some it is an advantage.  
14409	14768468	41816	9981694	Matthieu	Spacey loft with an excellent neighborhood, good coffee every morning at Abraco 7th street is a must to do.Definitly a plus for this loft but there are also some minors such as a creaking bed and two set of towels for 9 days is not enough. We can not play the TV, didnt get it working, that was a pitty during the worlcup plays.
14409	14917033	41819	15690272	Joel	As a first time user of Airnbnb i was a little skeptic but i was surprise of how smooth everything went renting from Ori. The apartment has an excelent location and Ori was really helpfull with all the information of all the cool spots nearby. The apartment is very cozy and i recomend it to anyone who wants to stay on the East Side.
14409	15995934	41840	9249836	Ash	The apartment is large and spacious. more than enough room for two people. The bathroom and kitchen are newly renovated. Air conditioning was definitely good enough to cool the place down quickly in summer. Saint marks place is a very lively street and is the perfect location in proximity to transport and all of the best bars and restaurants in Manhattan. Also within walking distance to West Village, Lower East Side and SoHo. Ori was a great host and very helpful and flexible with check in and out times. Would recommend to anyone and I would stay here again.
14409	16070523	41841	11970950	Tom	The reservation was canceled 61 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14409	16702383	41852	12673	Kirsten	Another great stay. It was my second time (find my first review for more elaborate praise) and I hope to return soon. No complaints! It's a great place.
14409	18869459	41884	4993959	Pablo	Nada mÃ¡s llegar al apartamento, nos sentimos en nuestro hogar en Manhattan, es exactamente tal y como aparece en las fotos. Muy limpio y espacioso, muy bien decorado, cÃ³modo y funcional. La cama muy cÃ³moda, a finales de agosto hace calor pero tienes aire acondicionado. La cocina bien equipada, buen sistema de audio/video. Y lo mejor de todo es la situaciÃ³n del apartamento, en el tramo tranquilo de St. MarkÂ´s Place, todo un clÃ¡sico del East Village. Todo lo que necesitas de compras bÃ¡sicas lo tienes en la misma calle, las recomendaciones dadas por el anfitriÃ³n fueron buenÃ­simas y la forma de contacto para el canjeo de llaves fue muy fÃ¡cil. No tuvimos mÃ¡s contacto que algunos mensajes, recogimos la llave en el bar de la esquina y la devolvimos a la encargada de la limpieza. Todo el mundo muy simpÃ¡tico. VolverÃ© a New York y sin duda volverÃ© a la mejor zona de todas, y si se puede, al apartamento de Ori.
14409	19309664	41892	1512027	Annett	Great stay, the apartment was like the pictures promised. Enjoyed our daily breakfast at the sunny deck. Good location, close to bars, restaurants, supermarket, coffee shops, subway etc. Not too far from east river bike-way if you prefer to have a morning run. Very good organization by Ori, when we arrived at the airport, we had already received a text message with instructions on how to get into the apartment. Can recommend staying here.
14409	19813057	41901	10628674	Virginie	"Nous avons sÃ©journÃ© 10 jours dans cet (URL HIDDEN) est conforme Ã  la description . Il est situÃ© Ã  environ 10 minutes Ã  pied d'une station de mÃ©tro , une seule ligne y passe mais elle est a une station de ""union square"" qui est trÃ¨s centrale , plusieurs lignes y passent, Cela est pratique pour vous dÃ©placer dans toute la ville. Il y a une foule de restaurants, bars dans le quartier. C'est une rue extrÃªmement animÃ©e , tous les soirs de la semaine. par contre, appartement Ã  Ã©viter si vous souhaitez du calme car la rue est assez bruyante. Cela ne nous a pas dÃ©rangÃ© pour dormir car vu le nombre de kilometres parcourus par jour, nous Ã©tions KO le soir !!Nous avons eu des serviettes et draps propres, ce qui Ã©tait tres pratique. L'appartement Ã©tait trÃ¨s trÃ¨s propre.La wi-fi n a pas fonctionnÃ© mais peut-Ãªtre que nous n'avions pas compris comment la faire fonctionner, nous n'avons pas demandÃ© Ã  Ori , car cela ne nous a pas dÃ©rangÃ©, Ã§a fait du bien de se dÃ©connecter un peu pendant les vacances!!!Nous n'avons pas vu Ori mais nous avons eu un contact sur place disponible si besoin .Nous n'Ã©tions pas dans un quartier ""central "", environ 30/40 mns a pied de times square . mais dans ce quartier, nous avons vraiment eu l'impression d'Ãªtre des ""new yorkais"" et avons Ã©tÃ© contents de ne pas sÃ©journer dans les coins touristiques .donc, appartement Ã  conseiller si vous souhaitez vous imprÃ©gner de la vie new yorkaise ""inside"" "
14409	20891526	41919	5151565	Rachel	Staying at Ori's was awesome.  He was easy to communicate with and everything was organised with all the needed info about the flat provided. The apartment looked exactly like in the pictures - possibly better. Compared to a hotel in NYC - fantastic value. On a great street with lots of food, drink and shop options and close to lots of subway lines if you want to venture it of the area. Super easy to get in and so no one needed to meet us. Highly recommend for a stay in NYC and I will definitely stay here next time in NYC if I can.
14409	21118425	41924	12630119	Jen	Great appartment - very spacious, good location. We really enjoyed our stay and Ori was very helpful and responded to emails quickly. 
14409	21456072	41930	1291187	Hans Erik	We had a terrific stay! The location is superb if you want to explore downtown Manhattan. The apartment was as portrayed, clean, and fully equipped. Although we never met him, Ori was a great host; always available, generously sharing his local secrets, as well as making the administrative matters easy for us (we were newbies to Airbnb). 
14409	21866133	41938	12089475	Ainhoa	"El apartamento estÃ¡ muy bien situado en el East Village, un barrio con mucho encanto y mucho ambientillo. Otra cosa a tener en cuenta es que estÃ¡ bien comunicado con el metro (lÃ­nea verde Astor Place y LÃ­nea amarilla Calle 8). El apartamento es super cÃ³modo y es genial que tenga un solo ambiente (muy espacioso). Es muy luminoso y tener una terracita es todo un lujo en NY (sobre todo si fumas). En la terraza por las noches es inevitable pensar en ""La Ventana Indiscreta"" de Hichcock.La cocina y el baÃ±o estÃ¡n nuevos."
14409	22177415	41944	13963340	DÃ©borah	L'appartement d'Ori est encore mieux que sur les photos, parfaitement situÃ©, parfaitement Ã©quipÃ© et fonctionnel. On s'y sent chez soi Ã  peine arrivÃ©. L'emplacement est idÃ©al, le quartier hyper vivant et tout peut se faire Ã  pied Ã  partir de chez lui ou avec la ligne 6 que l'ont prend Ã  Astor, qui fait tout Manhattan du nord au sud.  Le temps Ã©tait superbe lorsque j'y Ã©tais, la terrasse revÃªt alors tout son intÃ©rÃªt. On ne peut rÃªver meilleur pied Ã  terre pour arpenter NYC et faire de belles pauses agrÃ©ables dans un endroit apaisant et reposant. JE recommande vraiment ce lieu parfait. Merci Ori.
14409	22452179	41950	10591031	Emmanuel	Appartement trÃ¨s agrÃ©able Ã  vivre dans un super quartier de Manhattan. Transaction et contact faciles avec Ori et son contact sur place. Un pied Ã  terre idÃ©al pour rayonner Ã  NYC
14409	22642032	41954	16298801	Kim	We had a wonderful stay in Ori's apartment. Everything was as described, if not better. Easy access to the apartment at a time to suit us, and plenty of clean towels and linen. We would love to stay here again if we visit NYC in the future. Thanks Ori.
14409	23288879	41971	15992641	Erica	Ori's apartment on St Marks Place is an excellent base to experience life in NYC as a local rather than a tourist. Within 5 minutes walk are 4 different subway lines connecting you to basically all of Manhattan and brooklyn and easily out to JFK.I stayed for 15 nights as an extended trip and the flat was like a home from home. There are supermarkets including a whole foods within 10mins walk so great if you don't wait to eat out every night, although there is so much choice it would be easy to.The apartment is exactly as in the photos - clean, bright and spacious. The neighbours are super quiet, there is some noise from outside but if you have visited Nyc before you will know it never sleeps so some noise is to be expected. The only downside is the 2 flights of stairs up to the apartment (no lift) which didn't bother me but bear in mind with your luggage. An excellent find, I can't rank high enough. Ori and his friend who met us were both very helpful lots of recommendations (make sure to brunch at Cafe Orlin and eat at cafe mogador). I will be recommending this place to anyone visiting NYC in future. 
14409	23566505	41978	16347759	Michelle	We had a wonderful stay here, Ori's friend Lydia was lovely and met us late at night to show us the apartment when we first arrived.. The apartment looked even better in person and was lovely, clean and spacious. Everything worked perfectly and the kitchen was well equipped. It is in a relatively quiet area compared to Midtown and was only a few minutes walk from the subways (Astor Place/ NYU/ 1st Av). There is plenty of food/drink options on the street/nearby and Ori gave us some lovely recommendations also.  We did not get to meet Ori, however he was very fast on replying when we needed to ask him something. We would definitely recommend staying here and would stay here again if back in NYC. Thanks for sharing your place Ori!
14409	23683745	41981	9721736	Brandi	Ori's apartment was such a nice relief from most apts. in the city.  It was exactly as described, everything worked and it was easy to function within!  Not to mention for NYC it is huge and well located by a great nail salon, pizza joints and tons of bars!  My friend and I had a great time - more than enough room to really spread out and have a great weekend.  I will definitely stay here again!
14409	23936117	41988	15983220	Avi	Excellent
14409	24051301	41991	23351306	Jenn	The apartment matched Ori's description well. It was clean, in the heart of the East Village and pretty conveniently located to the subway (we took the 6, N and L quite a bit). Collecting the keys to the apartment was seamless. Overall, it was the perfect apartment for our short trip. I can't comment much on the appliances/other amenities as we mainly used the apartment to sleep.
14409	24460486	42002	11480327	Ron	We were met with a representative upon arrival and given keys. Detailed information was sent via email. Flat was as represented. We're older and the three flights of stairs are very steep. The location is excellent, especially for us as our son lives a block away. A good value for the money.
14409	25075201	42010	12227747	Caitlyn	Ori's place was in a fantastic location, an easy cab-ride from JFK and close to a number of subway stations. We didn't meet Ori, he was away, but his friend Lydia came to let us in and responded when we had a question about the place. The house was great - a huge studio with lovely kitchen, bathroom (looovely shower and bath) and lounge area. The apartment was warm and the perfect place to spend a week in NYC over New Years. We didn't get to use the outdoor deck much given it was the middle of winter, but we did enjoy one sunny breakfast out there which was divine! Perfectly located for going to all of the great bars and restaurants the lower east has to offer.In terms of the quality of the place - the apartment is huge and friends who live in NYC who came to visit were astounded at the size and quality of the apartment, in such a great location. The apartment was clean and mostly tidy, though this is obviously an apartment that someone lives in / uses as an office when in NYC, so there's a fair bit of personal stuff around and in the cupboards. Ori sent us a list of 'house rules' and suggestions for nearby restaurants etc. which was great, but perhaps a folder with some of the house appliance info and nearby attractions could be an addition to the apartment.Overall though, for the price, location, loveliness of the apartment - this is definitely a great spot for spending your holiday in the amazing city that is New York!
14409	25210598	42013	8749781	Eric	An amazing place to stay, the apt is huge, very well laid out, and really comfortable. Plus you are right on St Marks, close to everything. While I didn't meet the hosts, they were very nice as well as thoughtful via email. Would absolutely recommend this place to anyone who'd like to stay in the East Village. Thank you Ori!
14409	25405849	42019	12673	Kirsten	This is my 3rd time at Ori's. I love this place. Great location. Very clean and always a professional experience. Will visit again. 
14409	26315646	42044	25358491	Kevin	Had a spectacular stay at Ori's place. His recommendations for food, drinks, and stuff to do were completely on point. The neighborhood is really exciting and bustling, but not overwhelming. As 1st-timers to NYC this location rocked, being between midtown Manhattan and Brooklyn. Transit was really accessible.To get FULL use of this place, definitely come during nicer months; the back porch was really nice, but not ideal for NYC in the winter. 
14409	26729113	42053	20661444	Alex	Ori gave us an fantastic itinerary including places to eat and drink locally. Suggestions we took up eagerly! Lydia's communication and flexibility during our stay was very accommodating.As for the location we were right in the thick of East Village surrounded by some of the best coffee, food and independent stores New York had to offer. My wife was amazed at the choice of local Yoga classes!
14409	27424000	42067	11513246	Danny	My girlfriend and I spent a week in here and we had a great time. The apartment is spacious, clean and in an excellent location. Our flight arrived late in the evening but we were met with keys no problem.Ori also sent us an email with loads and loads of recommendations that we probably wouldn't have even known about - a nice touch.We'd definitely come back again - just a shame the cat wasn't there :)
14409	27923125	42078	26220161	Gowrie	We had a very pleasurable time here. Great apartment and location - an excellent base from which to launch forays into NYC, both into the East Village and beyond. Everything in the apartment was clean and well organized, and everything worked. 
14409	28166558	42082	2363395	Osnat	The loft was beautiful, organized and clean. We found everything we needed! 
14409	29491193	42102	9109379	Bud	We felt like we were home as soon as we opened the door. All of the instructions about location, access and facilities were accurate. The apartment had a contemporary feel, and everything we needed was there. The rear balcony allowed us to enjoy outdoor space, and we loved the East Village neighbourhood.
14409	29653087	42105	26877263	Victor	The reservation was canceled 55 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14409	29653089	42105	5462977	Eduardo	The reservation was canceled 48 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14409	29962210	42109	102426	Conny	Excellent location, beautiful apartment and easy communication with hosts. Highly recommended.
14409	30970461	42124	14461471	Cath	"Ori""s apartment is spacious, well equipped and the deck is an added bonus. The neighborhood is outstanding for food and entertainment and the subway if you want to get somewhere else.Ori""s recommendations were all great. Abraco best coffee we had in the US. And the WiFi was the same.Also check in and out and assistance from Lydia was very helpful.Highly recommended."
14409	31289194	42128	26248051	Craig	Amazing location on a bustling street. Apartment looks as advertised. Great local information provided by the host and responsive to questions. Very pleasant stay!
14409	32307191	42141	21876313	Jeremy	We have just returned from a fantastic trip to NY and the experience was made all the more enjoyable by our stay in this great apartment. It is clean, spacious, comfortable and in a great location. Whether you want to stay local and just enjoy the bars and restaurants of a real neighbourhood or explore further afield, this is an ideal place to stay. We did both and the latter was made very easy by the subway stations that are within a 5 to 10 minute walk away. The communication with Ori right up to our arrival was clear and helpful and he made us feel very welcome (although we never actually met face to face). Ori also provided us with a very useful local guide. I would definitely stay here again and will recommend it to my friends and family.
14409	32676037	42144	27401655	Jonathan	My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights, and loved the experience. The apartment was clean, comfortable and the addition of the outside space was a great bonus. Ori and Lydia made everything very easy and straightforward. The East Village is also a great place to stay, and this apartment is right in the middle of it all. Would not hesitate to re-book.
14409	33489879	42153	21306717	Marianne	Det var et skÃ¸nt og for os autentisk New Yorker lokalomrÃ¥de med masser af restauranter, barer og alternative forretninger, sÃ¦rligt tatovering og teaterliv er der gode muligheder for at dyrke. Lejligheden er super fin, og beskrivelsen stemmer helt overens med det lovede. Ori og Lydia sÃ¸rgede for at vi var godt orienterede og hjulpet.
14409	35362946	42173	1781237	Steve	The apartment is in a buzzing location in the east village, surrounded by every possible type of eatery, cocktail bar and restaurant. The apartment was clean, a good size, if somewhat functionally decorated.The balcony was a bit tired looking, but I understand that that is being upgraded.Lydia who met us from the airport was very responsive and helpful, making things easy for us upon arrival. Thanks!
14409	36503691	42184	5838545	Simon	A great apartment in the East a Village - the whole world right outside the door. Too many restaurants and bars to mention but the pizza bar on the corner saved us the first night when arriving late. Lovely large apartment - great having a verandah - quite noisy from the street but hey it's NY! Nice bath - good kitchen - strange floating wooden floor throughout that squeaked but it felt like being a tree hut so grew to like it. Would definitely  stay again.
14409	36977609	42188	31861887	Julie	I was visiting my daughter at NYU and this was a perfect spot - 1/2 mile from her and easy access to subway.  Loved the neighborhood, loved the apartment and the deck (rear window worthy!)  I would definitely stay there the next time when I am in town
14409	39903998	42212	14629881	Ines	We really enjoyed our long stay at OriÂ´s apartment. There are many good things about this loft: 1. great location, close to subway lines and many restaurants and bars worth exploring 2. spacious with tons of light and a great vibe 3. excellent shower 4. The apartment looks exactly as shown in pictures. 7. You have citibike docks just outside the main entrance. 8. Ori arranged everything so that we could have clean sheets and towels for all our stay. Somethings to note: there is no elevator (just so you know) and the stairs are long and steep. There is no freezer in the fridge which we missed for our long stay. 
14409	40907535	42219	33436555	Alexandre	TrÃ¨s bonne semaine passÃ©e dans cet appartement agrÃ©able, confortable, spacieux et, surtout, trÃ¨s bien situÃ© dans East Village, quartier idÃ©al.Merci Ori.
14409	44905588	42246	25856604	Kim	Our experience staying at Ori's apartment was smooth. It was an enjoyable stay and we couldn't have asked for a better location! There was a plethora of restaurants just at our doorstep to choose from. The space itself is spacious, clean and well decorated. Everything we needed was provided to us- linen, towels etc. The only constructive feedback I do have is that the bed could be more comfortable. After a long day of walking and wandering around the city, you can't underestimate how much of a difference a comfortable mattress makes for a good night's rest. With that being said, it was a minute glitch in an overall great experience. Gaining access to the apartment was effortless even though Ori was out of town. He did have a friend get in touch with us before and during our stay to let us know that she was nearby if we ran into any problems. We really appreciate that. I would stay here again when we are down for a visit.
14409	45368371	42249	32890372	Jane	As Ori was on holiday during our 3 night stay, he had made sure our stay there was fuss free and had arranged for his friend Lydia to caretake in his absence. Whilst we didn't actually meet, it was reassuring to know she was nearby if we needed her.The apartment itself was fantastic - as nice as it looks in the pictures - very bright, airy and spacious. It had everything we needed, including the lovely deck, although we didn't have time to use it due to a busy sightseeing schedule! The A/C worked a treat and was a godsend in the balmy summer temperatures.The East Village is a really cool part of Manhattan and it was great to see a less touristy side of the city. It was so easy to get around and was well located for the subway too.Would definitely stay in the apartment again if visiting again!
14409	45933588	42254	28058943	Ed & Sarah	Ori's flat is a perfect option for staying in NYC, the location is great and the neighborhood is vibrant, friendly and interesting . The flat is a good size, clean, private and with everything you need to relax after a busy day in the city. We had a fantastic stay, and using Ori's recomendations made our trip even more memorable.  
14409	46690065	42260	18957717	Natasha	We loved this apartment. It's as good as it looks in the photos - large, light & airy and the big balcony was a real bonus. We couldn't have asked for a better location. Lovely street in a great part of town, less noisy and full of tourists than other neighbourhoods but just as much going on. Ori gave us some great recommendations for good coffee and restaurants nearby before we arrived. He was away when we arrived but his friend ensured our arrival and stay was super easy. We would love stay to stay here again next chance we get to visit NYC.
14409	48262627	42272	13487973	Amara	The flat is ok but some things could be improved.  Cleaning was ok but there is quite dust, if you are allergic you will notice it. The windows close really bad, one of them was impossible to close it. The cleaning in the building must be improved. Also, the terrace floor is quite destroyed.  About Ori and his contact in NYC, they were very helpful with the information in the emails and flexible with the checkout time, as we need to stay until 13.30. We had a really good time in NYC, impressive city and friendly citizens.
14409	49200763	42279	5768018	Matthew	A great experience.  The apartment was terrific - extremely spacious for the price by downtown Manhattan standards.  In the heart of the East village, very close to key metro stops/lines.  Apartment very clean and well appointed.  The neighborhood is quite lively, so there can be noise at night, but your can hardly hear it in the apartment.   The shared spaces of the building are not the most elegant in New York, but are completely fine unless you're really precious.Kitchen very well equipped, bed comfy.We were met by Ari's friend who was very punctual, friendly and accommodating.  Ari was also very responsive prior to the visit.My parents actually stayed in this apartment (in their mid-60s) and loved it.  After staying in hotels for previous month, they found it really homely and a great experience.  
14409	49758090	42283	3618869	Peter	Ori's place was the perfect location for us. St Marks Place is friendly local and distinct from central Manhattan. Easy access to almost any where we wanted to go. We were met by Lydia even though we arrived quite late it was no concern to here. Ori was very quick to respond to my enquiry about the television. The flat itself is as described and comfortable for a loft style layout. Great wifi access too. 
14409	50165956	42287	15594109	Christine	As regular visitors to New York we try to stay in different locations for the full Big Apple experience!Ori's apartment is the first place that we want to book again. Bright, clean and quiet it has a great bed, shower and terrace and is in a perfect location in the East Village. Highly recommended. 
14409	54432362	42328	1689430	Jess	Great stay - easy/flexible check in.  Apt was exactly as described with excellent area recommendations that we took advantage of.  The outdoor space and the big open floor plan was a unique experience in NYC.  Last time we stayed in NYC we rented in Midtown and enjoyed our time in the East Village more - we would definitely recommend this apt and would stay again!
14409	54976844	42335	11554516	Florencia	The apartment was great, just as described in the pictures. Great location. Totally recomend it. And for sure we are coming back soon.
14409	57119388	42360	1530356	Daniel Eduardo	I had a great experience at Ori's place!The location is very convenient, close to public transportation, great restaurants and nice bars. The apartment itself is very comfortable! For NY standards it's big. Everything was spotless!The communication with Ori was always smooth and he gave me great advice for making my stay even better. I definitely recommend this apartment! 
14409	60313684	42391	12673	Kirsten	I have stayed here many times for a reason. It's great. A+ experience. From beginning to end. Great location and nice large clean space. Highly recommend. 
14409	60881161	42398	42283015	Victoria	Pasamos seis dias excelentes en el apartamento de Ori todo estuvo perfecto limpio. Muy buena ubicacion con muchos lugares para comer o tomar algo cerca y bien conectado para viajar. Muy buena la xucha y la cama. Tranquilidad para descansar. Super recomendable.
14409	61412941	42404	7337390	Robert	The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14409	61412942	42404	20761305	Clara	The host canceled this reservation 44 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
14409	61491235	42405	625889	Adrian	Ori was a great host who accommodated my travel needs for both arrival and departure. His apartment is located in the heart of the East Village with plenty of amazing coffee shops, restaurants and bars just steps away.The apartment had everything we needed, from heating for those cooler winter months, to a hair dryer, iron and plenty of closet space and hangers.Ori was gracious enough to provide us with some fantastic recommendations for places in the area. If you're a coffee fan you should really try AbarÃ§o just a block away on 7th St. The espresso is top notch (it's cash only).
14409	61978484	42410	30359538	Leandro	El departamento es amplio, muy confortable, muy limpio, muy  lindo. Y en pleno invierno, la calefacciÃ³n funcionÃ³ perfectamente. La ubicaciÃ³n es central, la misma cuadra en la que se ubica el departamento tiene mucho movimiento, gente, bares, lugares para comer, negocios, y a unas cinco cuadras lÃ­neas de metro para desplazarte. TambiÃ©n se puede ir caminando a varios puntos de interÃ©s. La Ãºnica crÃ­tica, leve por cierto, es el colchÃ³n, tal vez ya sea hora de ir pensando en cambiarlo. Pero la experiencia en general fue maravillosa y muy relajada.
14409	63884045	42428	2044439	Aleksandar	I had a great experience staying at Ori's place!  Ori and Lydia were very helpful and easy to communicate with. Ori left an info about the place and neighborhood which was awesome! I would definetly recommend staying at Ori's and will surely come back! Thank you Ori and Lydia!
14409	64501649	42434	38422406	Xavier	L'appartement proposÃ© par Ori Ã©tait trÃ¨s agrÃ©able pour un couple et idÃ©alement situÃ© pour visiter Manhattan Ã  pieds ou en mÃ©tro et, plus largement, tout NYC (les descriptions et les photos faites par Ori donnent un bon aperÃ§u de son appartement). La terrasse est un plus, mÃªme en hiver s'il fait beau. Le quartier, bien qu'un peu bruyant, est parfait pour boire un verre ou un cafÃ©, faire des courses alimentaires (organic of course) ou se restaurer. Bref, un endroit idÃ©al pour visiter NY et vivre - temporairement - comme un new-yorkais.
14409	68711213	42466	953569	Jennifer	What a terrific find! To find this amount of room and space in such a terrific location was an unexpected delight. Having a kitchen with a refrigerator (no freezer to speak of) and a nice dining space allowed us to have a low key breakfast or lunch on site when we were short on time or didn't want to go out. The kitchen has all the basics that any visitor needs. It was also nice to have a flatscreen TV, wireless, and a radio. The space is tidy, but does have some personal effects, so it's not just an empty space. Happily, details such as hangers, iron, and hair dryer are provided. If you're sensitive to sound, do know that you'll hear some street noise, plus the charming character of the place includes very squeaky floors. Also, the 2.5 flights of stairs up, are steep, so if you've got heavy bags or bad knees, be warned! Ori and his friend, Lydia, who met us, were very friendly and responsive to every inquiry. Ori provides a great outline of the apartment and super helpful suggestions about restaurants and other resources. We would happily stay here again.
14409	70195438	42476	11577896	Verena	Das Apartment von Ori war fÃ¼r uns perfekt. Tolle Lage, jede Menge Bars und Restaurant im Umfeld und super zentral. Man erreicht in Manhattan alles fuÃ?lÃ¤ufig oder ist in 5 Minuten bei der Metro Station.Die Kommunikation und der Check in haben wunderbar funktioniert und das Apartment bietet alles was man braucht, angefangen von neuer modernen KÃ¼che und Bad bis hin zur gemÃ¼tlichen Couch nach langen Sightseeing-Tagen.Wir wÃ¼rden jederzeit wieder das Apartment von Ori buchen!
14409	70737600	42480	28942165	Holly	Dear Ori. I really enjoyed my stay in your loft... Every thing was as advertised and loved the outside deck Didnt use the BBQ but should have... The bed was perfect for me ..loved the neighborhood ,which is one of my favorites in nyc .. Looking forward to repeating the experience the next time we are in the city.. Best wishes. Ciao. Roberto
14409	71789272	42488	59614535	Sophie	A nice appartment, very confortable and well located in Mark place. A lot of restaurant around the appartment. Ori is very helpfull and give us a lot of good adress. Thanks we enjoyed our trip. 
14409	73857490	42500	40402528	Pamela	Excellent apartment y the best location of NY. Near everything. The apartment is sunny and huge, rare in NY. We had a great time!
14409	75301049	42510	12673	Kirsten	I've stayed here many times it's great. It's become my home away from home. I recommend it highly. 
14409	77358238	42521	8125756	Philip	The apartment and the neighborhood were awesome! Plenty of restaurants and bars on the same street. The place was comfortable and spacious just as it's listed in the listing page. The owner provided some amazing food recommendations upon our arrival. All in all I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to stay in East Village. 
14409	78863600	42530	11448709	Alma Maria	Ein gerÃ¤umiges Apartment im coolen East Villiage Viertel. Die Lage ist super, drum herum viele Lokale, Cafes und Bars. Das Apartnent hat alles, was man braucht und ist perfekt, um ein paar Tage in NYC zu verbingen. Leider ist es hinten auf dem Balkon sehr laut von den vielen Klimaanlagen drum herum (das sind wir in Deutschland wohl nicht gewohnt) so dass dieser nicht zum Verweilen einlÃ¤d. Alles in Allem waren wir mit unserem Aufenthalt zufrieden, Ori und Lydia sind sehr entspannte Gastgeber. 
14409	80535312	42539	5498158	Jonathan	This place ticks all the right boxes. The apartment is well appointed and comfortable with a well equipped kitchen. It's very nice to have some outside space but the deck could do with a bit of work. The location is excellent if you want to soak up the East Village vibe. 
14409	83016298	42551	16150054	Jessica	Ori and Lydia made it very easy to access the apartment. Big space, in great area of east village. Apartment has everything you need. Nice big balcony. 
14409	84185929	42556	53554771	Kate	Ori's place was the best welcome to New York we could have had. Ori contacted us in advance and explained his friend Lydia would be in touch to sort out access to the apartment. Lydia was communicative and helpful and, while she was unable to meet us in person, gave clear instructions to collect the keys from a bar around the corner. All very smooth! Ori also gave us an extensive list of recommendations for local places to eat and drink, some of which we tried and thoroughly enjoyed (Sobakoh & Stromboli's!). It was great to have that local knowledge to start us off. The apartment is exactly as in the pictures, lovely and spacious and was exceptionally clean on arrival. The bathroom is small but perfectly formed and the shower has excellent water pressure. The air con was effective and the bed very comfortable. We didn't use the kitchen but it was well equipped and appeared to have everything you'd need if you wanted to self cater. The apartment is in a superb location for enjoying everything the East Village has to offer. We absolutely loved the vibe of this neighbourhood with its numerous bars, restaurants and cafÃ©s; more independents than chains which is great for variety. The apartment is also very close to the 1st Ave L train metro stop for easy access to the rest of Manhattan. We felt at ease and safe around the EV and would definitely check if Ori's place is available when we return to NYC in the future. 
14409	85246780	42561	23073045	Vincent	Ori was a great host, he provided us instructions on how to get into the apartment as well as some awesome espresso, food and cocktail recommendations for the city. He also got us connected with Lydia who helped us with any questions during our stay. We had a great time in NYC and thanks to the location of this apartment were able to explore quite a few areas in a span of 4 days.
14409	87399029	42570	17206809	VÃ©ronique	Ouri's, apartment was perfect. Very spacious with a large balcony & all that you need. Located in one of the most animated parts of Greenwich Village.Surrounded by every shop you can think off especially restaurants. Access to transportation could not be easier. I highly recommend this apartment & will try to use it again when visiting NYC.Guy and Ronnie
14409	88852352	42576	2240033	Daniel	Beautiful loft in a really great part of town. St Marks is a little young and wild, but there is so much to see and do around the area. 1st Ave has tons of great restaurants and it's easy to access anywhere in the East Village. Really enjoyed our stay. Ori provides plenty of information on the place and with insider tips as well. It was an easy stay and just a really nice place to crash at night. Would definitely recommend it if you're looking to stay in the East Village area. Much nicer than a hotel. 
14409	89488078	42579	60280628	Nicole	Ori and Lydia were very thorough and helpful hosts, providing many tips on the area--the best pizza, espresso, even dry cleaners! We loved this spacious loft, and thoroughly enjoyed the area. The bathroom and kitchen were lovely, and the bed comfortable. It was nice to have the deck as an option, although it is in need of some repairs. We would definitely consider staying here again! 
14409	91636724	42588	6170995	Debashish	We had a great four night stay at Ori's loft in the East Village. The location on St. Mark's Place is fantastic, with plenty of restaurants/etc. and nearby subway access. With Ori's detailed instructions, it was easy to find the place. The loft itself is large and well appointed, with a particularly nice kitchen and bathroom.A couple of things to note: there are two flights of stairs and no elevator, so pack accordingly! Also, while the apartment itself is secure, the building itself is less so. We noticed that the front gate/door was typically left unlocked when we returned in the evenings - possibly because a small, two-room museum occupies the ground floor. Nevertheless, we would definitely stay here again!

14409	96649440	42605	59673275	Chloe	Fantastic location and modern apartment! Photos in ad are spot on - we really loved our week here. Very comfortable stay, with everything you need. Lively neighbourhood with an awesome buzz. Highly recommend this property and area.
14409	98953051	42615	56354897	Patrick	Great location, lots of space, just a short Uber ride away from Times Square.
14409	105410042	42644	17446093	Catherine	Ori nous a fournis toutes les indications sur le logement ainsi que les lieux oÃ¹ l'on pouvait se restaurer, prendre un cafÃ©, sortir. La remise des clÃ©s a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s facile mÃªme si je n'ai pas rencontrÃ© Ori, il nous avait donnÃ© les coordonnÃ©es tÃ©lÃ©phoniques d'une personne qui rÃ©pondait aux messages de suite.  
14409	106750687	42650	9757379	Ariane	Ein super Appartement in einer trendigen Umgebung, trotzdem sehr ruhig und eine tolle Terrasse mit Grill!
14409	107736348	42655	7807650	Kajsa	We had a great stay in NY this autumn (7-11th October) and especially East Village provided an interesting contrast to mid- and uptown Manhattan. Somehow a genuin touch of unpolished NY. The apartment was spacious, clean and well-equipped (with a plus for good wine glasses). The roof terrace was also a bonus and we actually sat outside quite a few times. Ori had provided us with some great suggestions for restaurants, bars etc. We met a few very sympathetic locals at the bar on the other side of the street on 1st (Vbar St Marks), great place-go there!, which also had a few a good insiders of which a few will follow below.Cafe Mogador-breakfast, middle eastern eggs, unexpected, but fantastic!Tompkins Square Bagels (7th)-salmon bagel. You will be stuffed for three hours :-)Stromboli Pizza- serious pizza joint. The Bean (2nd), very good coffee (and music by the way).Once again, the VBar St Marks is really worth a visit. If Ann is there pls say hi ;-)Morton Williams Wine & Spirits on Park Ave S is the place if you interesting in bying fine wine.All together a warm recommendation for Ori's place. We will definitely return one day.
14409	108922171	42661	71722144	Rodrigo	Excelente Loft, ubicaciÃ³n privilegiada, realmente se disfruta y no se extraÃ±a laCasa de uno. Feliz de haber elegido esta ubicaciÃ³n.
14409	111753568	42675	62680785	Teyfik	Ori and Lydia were very helpful and although we did not get the chance to meet Ori he was very actively involved to ensure  that everything would go well and gave us lots of tips on what you could do in the east village. Lydia has given us the keys and was very friendly and helpful and we always had the chance to contact her.The apartment had everything you needed. It was spacious and perfectly located in the vibrant East Village. The venue was packed with restaurants and bars. The metro was only 5 minutes walking , times square/ midtown is a 10 min ride . We thank Ori and Lydia for  our fine stay and we would recommend this appartment to everyone!
14409	112040821	42677	6090263	Gary	The location on St. Mark's Place is excellent for the East Village.Host Ori's detailed instructions make everything easy. The loft itself is big & open, with modern kitchen and bathroom. Second floor walk up. Stairs a bit dingy.Very buzzy neighbourhood which naturally means much noise; sirens, hooting. It is the village after allâ?¦Would use again.
14409	115131079	42696	267619	Jennifer	The apartment is huge (by NY standards) and located in a vibrant part of the city near several Subways. We would def try to stay here again. It's a perfect place to explore the city and live like a New Yorker. The only minor issue is the (URL HIDDEN) certainly not the quietest street. That said, our hosts have no control over NYC. Plus, you don't travel to NY to sleep! Packing earplugs would easily remedy this. :) 
14409	117106227	42708	90328759	Joslynn	Ori was a great host! He was communicative and helpful during our stay. We loved the location and his suggestions. We look forward to our next stay!
14409	120381471	42714	2028038	Penny & John	This apartment has a good location and is spacious. The steps up to the apt. are steep. Check-in arrangements were changed without any notification, and we were left standing on the sidewalk. When inside the apartment we found dirty wine glasses and rubbish not emptied. There was no working light in the bathroom which was reported at the outset and NO attempt to fix it during the 5 days we were there. Any movement at all in the bed caused loud squeaking. If you want to make a cup of coffee, make sure you ask the host to provide you with this facility.
14409	121296766	42719	13320538	Anne	Great location for nightlife. Walkable to public transit. Easily accessible. Apartment is just like it is presented in description. Comfortable and clean. Secure security gate gives you peace of mind.
14409	123088792	42731	93516406	Annelies	Great area! Spacious appartment. Nice to have a table; not often available in nyc airbnb's. Great kitchen and bathroom (shower was lovely). Compensation for the broken heater was very much appreciated. Thanks again. 
14409	125023108	42738	91691657	Roger	The apartment is perfect, located in a magnificent neighbourhood with a lot of nightlife, great restaurants and located close to public transportation and lower manhattan in no time. The apartment is very spacious, very very clean and we felt at home all throughout. We highly recommend this apartment to anyone that is willing to spend sometime in New York and enjoy the day to day like a local, Ori is great at giving indications on how to do that...We will definitely go for it once again if we ever make it to New York, thanks to Ori for taking care of us and ensuring that all the details were taken care of. 
14409	126142229	42744	636399	Geri	El departamento es muy lindo y muy bien cuidado. La ubicaciÃ³n es para mÃ­ una de las mejores en Manhattan . SÃºper recomendable ! Estoy segura que volverÃ© ! Gracias ori por todo ! 
14409	129676574	42767	64552737	David	Ori's place is a rare find, both for NYC and the East Village. I personally love the big open space, and I only wish it had been warm enough to make use of the back deck. Excellent location right across the street from my favorite taqueria. Would be delighted to stay here again on another trip to NYC!
14409	131263374	42777	23231938	Tegan	I really enjoyed my stay. Everything was as described. The apartment was clean & comfortable. The location was great - really central. I'd happily stay again. 
14409	132848203	42785	102776950	Keith	The photos and description of the apartment are accurate and even understated.  Lots of space; well outfitted; super comfortable bed; an inviting living room; very useful and modern kitchen; and an updated bathroom with a killer shower. Although we visited during some real winter weather, a sudden change to warm conditions even allowed us to enjoy a morning (in the middle of February no less)  out on the back deck enjoying the sun, coffee and New York Times. Unlike the hotels that I have stayed at in New York over the years, Ori's place is located in a real neighbourhood with real shops, lots of restaurants, bars and a happy vibe.  It is pretty amazing that multiple subway lines are at most 10 minutes walk away making trips to broadway or anyplace for that matter a breeze. Ori provides some good tips on dining and such. We took him up on a recommendation of Abarco for coffee one morning and of Frank's restaurant for dinner one evening and both lived up to his billing. There are lots of places nearby to discover such as the Porto Rico Coffee and Tea importing shop with an amazing selection and a cheese shop that has a decent selection  to mention just two that we chanced on. All in all, a superb place to stay that made our visit to New York all the more pleasant and memorable. 
14409	134868079	42795	7142037	Thierry	Nice apartment and the host is helpful. Nice neighborhood with many restaurants and shops.
14409	135597643	42799	2520837	X	You can't find a more perfect location thank st. Marks pl. Walking distance to all the fun things in east village.  Checking in process is extremely easy.  The apartment is clean and well equipped.  The lovely balcony would be another reason I would want to visit again during the summer. FIVE STARS!
14409	136855387	42806	22497708	Ruby	Really excellent apartment, clean and well equipped. Excellent location!
14017	100492592	42622	29956403	Cole	Fantastic!So simple process, it was clean, neat, and felt like home. Left a bar of chocolate which was nice and it was over all very pleasant.

3864	127217283	42751	13050022	Asitha	Great place and easily accessible to the train into Manhattan. 
3864	128293121	42758	1534070	Joel	Great Location.  Easy Access to the Chauncey Street Station (J Train) in to Manhattan.  L train access for a short walk.  Close to Local Shops.  Express access to FiDi on the AC.  Walkable distance to Bushwick.  Room was cozy and comfortable, bathroom was clean.  Anyone looking for something outside of the Manhattan should consider.
3864	131508975	42778	6886695	Tiki	Great location to the E & C trains. The room is neat and cozy. I had a great stay. Thanks Anais!

3864	133096632	42786	6047591	Sandy	This was the perfect spot for a weekend getaway, close to two different train lines, and a direct shoot into Manhattan. Exposed brick was an added perk.

17968	70600328	42478	49418369	John & Gail	Staying at Iris Apartment was in general a very good experience, Iris was not at the Apartment, however we met her on our last day stay, she left a very good impression on us, Iris is a very warm, open and full of life person.Kyle, Iris roommate was accommodating, friendly, kind and very helpful.  Kyle made us feel very much at home.Please inform guests about the ladder to the attic and also please disclose smokers live in the apartment.  We do not smoke and the strong smell of the 420 daily did affect us negatively.Sheets and comforters needs to be upgraded, bed was not the most comfortable.  No bathroom in the Attic room we stayed in made it difficult to navigate from the attic room up and down on the ladder during the night to use the bathroom was challenging.Iris generously offered us a late check out at no extra charge.  We were very grateful for the late check out. Thank you Iris for your conversation and generosity in hosting us.Thanks John & Gail
17968	71837737	42489	32297625	Bettina	The room was exactly as described, perfect for either a couple plus one or two people, which was our case. Iris had just moved out, but her 2 roommates were extremely helpful and welcoming. Wanted to leave my thank you to them. The attic stairs were not a problem, we got used to them pretty quickly. The neighborhood is wonderful! Grocery store around the corner, bakery at the corner, wonderful pizza half a block away and anything else you may need not further than a block away! We loved our stay! And Iris took her time to make sure everything would be okay for us before we arrived. Thanks, Iris! 
14106	27951154	42078	8180429	Vita	Communication with Trisha was great - she has accepted booking promptly, then later informed us that her friend will be checking us in as she is going to be in Paris at that time.  Had no problem with checking in - her friend Kristina was already waiting for us. When it comes to the apartment - it was really messy and dirty. Things were on the ground, bunch of hair in the bathroom. I don't assume bed sheets were changed before or after us.. Overall- location is really good - apartment has a potential, and who knows maybe when Trisha is present she takes the whole hosting thing more seriously, but I would not call our stay overly pleasant.

14106	44610068	42243	42238084	Edgar	Trish is awesome! I stayed in her place for three nights and I absolutely loved it. It was like having a down to earth roommate. Her apartment is in a great location, and it was very easy to get around just by walking a couple of minutes. I strongly recommend her as a host.  
14106	57661361	42366	16009004	ValÃ©rie	This accomodation scores with its Location and host: Trisha was very welcoming and our arrival was organised perfectly. Also the location makes the main attractions and cool areas very easily accessible. Main downturns were the lack of space to hang clothes (hanger provided at the back of the bedroom door but using it meant that the door cannot be closed anymore) and that the apartment (especially kitchen, floor and bathroom) need some cleaning. The accomodation is perfectly fine for a short stay when you mainly spent your time visiting the city and just come here to sleep.
14106	58858812	42374	1654565	Brad	Had a very pleasant experience! Her place was very centrally located to everything that we wanted! Definitely would recommend, and stay with her again!

9485	21441039	41929	13713091	Scott	From the moment I entered the home Jessica and her family made me feel welcome and at home.  Upon arrival Jessica dropped everything and provided an amazing running route.  She  sketched it out on the back of a post card so I would not get lost.  If you are a runner be sure to ask Jessica about Prospect park, you will not be disappointed.  Running in that park was one of the most amazing experiences while staying in Brooklyn.  This home and my room were a peaceful and calming retreat from a busy city.  If you have ever had doubts or concerns about the house share option on Airbnb please consider the Notorious BNB.  You will not likely get another opportunity to stay in such an amazing home anytime soon.  I had all of the privacy I needed to recharge every night before my next day of work.  The home is perfectly located between resturaunts in Fort Green on Dekalb and Clinton Hill on Mrytle.  Great food is only blocks away from the front door.  When I missed Jessica during the day she communicated with me via email and text.  I always knew what was going on in the house and what to expect when coming back to the house.  Five stars is not enough for my wonderful experience at the Notorious BNB.   
9485	30886008	42122	622460	Justin	we rented the room to stay rather than for a shoot.  we LOVED the house and the breakfast was great.  we didn't get to meet Jessica as she was sick.
9485	37541040	42192	8857829	Sakura	The place is just as extravagant, beautiful, and simply beautiful as shown in the pictures. Just wow! Jessica is quick to respond and extremely helpful. I would recommend this place to anyone who want to experience true luxury. 
15258	4262428	41386	5956039	Laura	Dominique's Getaway was exactly as described and shown in the pictures: clean and neat, and adjacent to a shared bathroom. The room also included a TV w/cable, fruit, bottled water, coffee maker, coffee, and tea.Vie communicated with me professionally and quickly, and she accommodated my last-minute request (on a Thurs) to stay at Dominique's Getaway that Friday & Saturday night.The property was about a 7 min walk from the subway stop--very convenient!Overall, I had an extremely pleasant stay. I highly recommend Dominique's Getaway and working with Vie.
15258	7573329	41541	8539297	Zwane	Vie was an excellent host.The room is huge and clean  with cable TV and a small refrigerator.WiFi was also available as well.The bed was huge and comfy.I booked the room last minute and Vie was very accommodating.The kitchen and bathroom are shared but they both are very clean and neat.Everyone in the house was very friendly,yet they gave my boyfriend and I ample privacy with no disruptions.I especially love the quiet neighborhood that it is located in.Its also  very close to the subway  and buses in case you love to travel.Overall ,I would definitely book a room with Vie again,she was the best.
15258	7765627	41548	8539297	Zwane	Vie is the greatest.We visited for a second time and the room was exceptionally (URL HIDDEN) one bothered us...we were able to come and go as we pleased with no problems.The area is quiet and safe.My boyfriend even loves it.DEF a good place to relax and have your own privacy.
15258	8106345	41562	9295822	Paul	The room was great and exactly as it appears. Having access to a kitchen is wonderful. Vie even put out a lovely bowl of fruit. Positive vibrations. 5 train service to manhattan/brooklyn/queens lengthy and sparse late nights. 
15258	9533900	41640	10786042	Latrice	Nice private room. Vie was very hospitable, and helpful.
15258	18842008	41883	20004555	Greg	Overall, my girlfriend and I had a good experience. We felt welcome the moment we arrived. The room was clean and the A/C worked great. Couldn't ask for a better host. The subway is a two block walk which was very convenient. 
15258	20725025	41916	21532197	Reynard	Awesome, very welcoming
15258	20904786	41919	20401082	James	Hi Ms. Vie! Loved the room! Exactly the way it's presented online, extremely nice host. This was my first time using Airbnb so I was a little nervous, but she made me feel really comfortable. I'll always chose Dominique's Getaway when I visit the Bronx..  Thank you
15258	31021128	42124	26372553	Willie	Vie is the consummate hostess.  The rooms are comfortable and immaculate, and she prepares all sorts of nice touches that make the place seem homey in small ways and large.  I had extended my stay already and hope to be back again in the future.
15258	36580178	42184	32679245	Yanz	The stay was quite fine. It's very close to everywhere-we took the train to Coney Island ,Manhattan and taxi to shopping malls and resturant a close by and we had a lovely stay. The bathroom was very clean and we appreciated this a lot. I hardly saw other guests. Vie was always available to be contacted in case of any issues you might have. I felt welcome however still had my space. Lovely home,enjoyable stay, as this was my first time using airbnb I had issues booking-Vie assisted my whole process. Thanks Vie (see you again)
15258	41169844	42220	37632392	Brittney	Vie is an outstanding host! My fiance and I enjoyed the 4 nights spent at Vie's. Our reservations were very last minutes, but Vie made things work out. As listed her checkout time is noon, but I had a late flight. She was kind enough to allow me to extend my stay a few extra hours. The room is hotel status. Very clean, and equipped with all necessities to make you feel at home. The house is located near a main street so we were able to catch the bus and easily transfer to the train. There were various eateries near by and a HUGE shopping mall minutes away. The taxi service recommended was awesome. Very respectful drivers with reasonable rates. I would recommend Vie's place before recommending a hotel in the area. Vie, I look forward to doing business with you again. Thanks for everything!!! :-)

15132	82586835	42549	17288835	Katia	"Perfect location! Cultured, creative, arts-oriented, safe and really friendly area fabulous bars and restaurants for all budgets and tastes. Our favourite was ""Beauty Bar"" with free comedy shows and manicures?! Great for exploring as its on the big bus tour route and is a nexus for buses and subway lines.As it was Juliana's room, we were met by Matthew who is above and beyond sweet - even walked me to the grocery stores.   The apartment immediately felt like home, well, an artist's home. It had all we could want and is decorated with installation multimedia works that provoke ideas about contemporary life in NY. We took a punt even though it was new on airbnb with no reviews... it will be my first choice in NY from now on!"
15132	83542452	42554	80562844	Julian	We were greeted by Mathew who's was really nice and helpful and he introduced us to the town and told us where to start. The bed was comfortable and the apartment itself was pretty spacious for 2 people. Very close to a lot of eateries and transportation. Had fully supplied bathroom so we didn't have to buy any toiletries. Very artsy decor.Good cozy place to stay for a few days.
15132	87915447	42573	4207863	MaÃ¯ka	Prefect location, awesome host and perfect room for a short stay in New York. Matthew was sweet, kind and very helpful upon arrival...and we barely saw each other as we were both busy-bees...but he was always ready for questions. I'd recommend the place to anyone who'd like to visit New York and stay in a great location. 
15132	89225318	42578	81550704	Ondrej	UbytovÃ¡nÃ­ bylo perfektnÃ­. NecelÃ© 2 mÃ­le od empire state building a asi 20 minut pÄ?Å¡ky od greenwich vilage. Hostitel byl velmi milÃ½ a poradil nÃ¡m hodnÄ? s metrem. Komunikace s hostitelem byla taky bez problÃ©mÃº a rychlÃ¡. Kdybych se vrÃ¡til do NY urÄ?ite bych tady rÃ¡d bydlel znova.
15132	100536265	42622	58529621	Victoria	Had a good stay here in New York. We went during a time when it was outrageously hot and humid, so the place was on the warmer side. We were provided a small fan for the bed and one to circulate air from outside. Host was very accommodating and nice. She checked in on us a to ensure that everything was going well and we had everything we needed.
15132	107299162	42652	83423262	Paolo	"Nos hospedamos con Juliana y MarÃ­a, dos chicas que resultaron ser unas personas increÃ­bles, divertidas, y amables, que fueron muy lindas en todo momento y nos ayudaron con todo lo que necesitÃ¡bamos. Ellas incluso nos mostraron una parte de la ciudad que no hubiÃ©ramos conocido sin su invitaciÃ³n y la pasamos increÃ­ble con ellas. El departamento estÃ¡ muy bien ubicado y puedes caminar a cualquier lugar o tomar el metro que estÃ¡ a una calle de distancia. El lugar es pequeÃ±o, pero muy acogedor y tienes todo lo que necesitas para descansar despuÃ©s de un largo dÃ­a. El mejor lugar para hospedarte en Manhattan. Les gusta que digas ""Hola"" cuando llegas al departamento. Tuvimos una excelente experiencia en este lugar, sÃºper recomendado!"
15132	122906704	42730	32433524	Aljane	Short stay, but already one of my best experiences on Airbnb. Julianna waited for us as we landed on the 24th of December, was very helpful and we felt welcomed even though we barely saw each other. The location was perfect, a lot of restaurents, bars and subway stations nearby and we get to try some of her recommandations. We loved stayin in such an artsy place. I highly recommend and would be glad to return and be hosted by Julianna.
15132	125394542	42740	1704655	Iair	Juliana fue de gran ayuda en todo momento. La contactamos en plena nochebuena, cuatro dÃ­as antes de llegar, y la comunicaciÃ³n fue muy fÃ¡cil. Ella estaba de viaje asi que pudimos disponer de todo el apartamento. Pero tanto Juliana como sus amigas estuvieron siempre disponibles para ayudarnos. La ubicaciÃ³n de este departamento es Excelente! es el corazÃ³n de East Village, a 1 cuadra del metro L, es la zona ideal para salir, pasear, regresar de noche. Super seguro! Y muchas tiendas abiertas. Recomendamos a la morada nadahada. :)
15132	125980431	42743	1704655	Iair	Recomiendo este lugar y a Juliana como anfitriona! :) (Ya he escrito otra review muy positiva  sobre mi estadÃ­a aquÃ­). Esta vez tuve que quedarme 3 noches por un cambio de vuelo. Juliana a pesar de encontrarse de viaje, siempre estuvo disponible y me ayudÃ³ a resolverlo.
15132	133749316	42790	23228180	Minjoon	Very cozy, very convenient location. Juliana was a great host. She allowed us to stay till 4pm on the day of check out. Highly recommended! 
31568	114209455	42690	35869644	Rockie	Super accommodating host, Phenix was wonderful and communicative. The location is unbeatable! I've never seen a nicer home, so spacious and beautifully decorated - truly worth every penny. 
31568	115424014	42698	49368855	Stephanie	I booked Phenix's place for my boss for his stay in New York. My boss can be picky so I was expecting to hear some feedback about what may not be right with the loft, however I didn't hear a word which means he was happy. Happy boss = A happy me. :)
1367	77294030	42521	2408398	Sabrina	The stay was good, however an inconvenience that it wasn't clean when we arrived. Also there was hair in the tub that really grossed us out. 
1367	78500046	42528	72183886	Emanuel	I really enjoyed my stay here! The apartment was clean and exactly as described. The neighborhood was also good, with a convenient subway station and many authentic places to eat and drink. Although we never met our host, she was always available for any questions through text and also allowed us to check in early when our plane arrived earlier than expected. 
1367	79597720	42534	23709900	Emma	Bon airbnb, bien placÃ©, petit mais suffisant pour quelques joursOn a passÃ© un bon week end entre copines!
1367	85790674	42564	35935235	Ditte	We enjoyed our stay in Josephine's apartment. It was close to the subway and grocery stores, and Josephine was easy to reach. The apartment was very hot at times, though, but it didn't stop us from having a good time in New York over all.
1367	88283483	42575	5883983	Ali	+) Great place near to Subway, only 15min to Time square.Josephine answer for all question in the same  day.Highly recomended -) the air conditioning is just for this appartement but after 2 hours of use it's ok Thanks you for all 
1367	91831531	42588	72232188	Laurence	Bonne description de l'appartement. Celui-ci Ã©tait trÃ¨s propre, le mÃ©nage y avait Ã©tÃ© fait. Nous avons apprÃ©ciÃ© le calme du quartier, de l'immeuble aprÃ¨s l'effervescence du centre de NYC.
1367	95447003	42601	55772997	Christian	We are thanking to Josephine, she quikly respond to our demand when we notice a lake of micro-wave, when we asked her fore an extra blanket, and when the air conditioning broke down.The area is realy nice, close to the train station and there are many good restorants.
1367	95451166	42601	2576527	Tenzin	The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1367	96914182	42607	48694979	Brice	Josephine welcomed us very well, giving us all the informations we needed for checking in/out, the place is nice and clean, just as it is announced, really not far from the subway. We were able to easily communicate with Josephine (we had small issue which was fixed in a matter of hours) and I recommend her place for anyone willing to visit the queens or manhattan 
1367	98543265	42613	25721125	Haze	This place is closed to subway and close to most major attraction.   But it is not easy to find parking because street parking is limited.   The room is not as clean as i expected.  The AC in the house is not as strong but  was getting better after 2 hour.   Josephine is easy to communicate and very fast on responding our questions. 
1367	99678312	42618	79154376	Kevin	Both Josephine and the location were awesome! Josephine was very proactive in making sure we got into the apartment with no issue. Her house manual was very accurate and easy to follow!The apartment itself was spacious and comfortable accommodated all 6  of us. We were also pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to find parking on the weekends (we never either of our 2 cars more than a block away).
1367	99956700	42619	93551454	Jacob	I liked the place, simple and clean. You might think the space is a bit small, but it had everything we needed. Satisfied.
1367	103840671	42637	39785428	Mac	A good place to stay over. Would book it again.
1367	104622818	42640	91045233	Or	We had a great time in the apartment and it was just like we expected. Josephine was very nice and available whenever we needed anything.The apartment was very clean and we had everything that we needed. The only problem was the stove that had gas issue, which Josephine help us with and said will be fixed soon.The apartment was just about 20 minutes in the metro from Times Square and had everything we needed around it.
1367	105956176	42646	7334080	Lauren	simple place, worked for our group! we weren't at the apartment for the majority of the time, just needed a place to sleep. 
1367	108118857	42657	65638636	Axel	Nice appartment in astoria ! My friends and i had a great in the neighborhood ! Recommended for groups that Want to discover NYC ! 25min away with the Subway from Time square 
1367	111758683	42675	72377431	Brian	This was a great inexpensive place to stay with a large amount of people while visiting the city. It's relatively small and simple, but there are so many things to do in NY you will be finding yourself only coming back to sleep. Overall, a very good value.
1367	113247321	42685	70997982	Mengqi	nice neighborhood. not too far from subway
1367	113384287	42686	15820666	Hugo	The apartment was nice and comfortable, I like that the bathroom and kitchen were very clean, we had clean sheets and towels.We were able to communicate with Josephine very easy. Check in and Check out was so easy.I will recommended this place.Thank you! Josephine.
1367	115697508	42700	33001724	Belinda	We enjoyed staying at Josephine's place for a week during our visit to New York. It's well located just a short walk to the Astoria Blvd metro and then about 15 minutes into Times Square. The unit is pretty basic but it was clean and the beds were comfy. A TV probably wouldn't go astray, just to keep the kids quiet after a big day of sightseeing in NYC. Thanks for hosting us.
1367	115996918	42701	91996919	Alexandra	Josephine was super sweet and helpful. Even though I wasn't able to meet her she kept in touch. Any questions I had she answered. She leaves you detailed information so your not lost. The neighborhood was nice & quiet. The apartment was very spacious and clean. Thanks Josephine :)!
1367	121027047	42717	101299245	Eleni	Close to all the transportation, restaurants and Greek nightlife. It will be great if the bathroom was cleaner and if was a second mirror in the house. One little in the bathroom is not enough for 5 people to get ready the same time. Otherwise it's a great place , perfect location.
1367	121245104	42719	98543543	Michael	Highly recommend this place the location is just a few minutes away from the train and only a 15 minute ride to manhattan. The place was very comfy and relaxing with a great outdoor area. 
1367	121499500	42721	45949234	Christopher	Good location to get into town from Queens. 
1367	125206617	42739	57954827	Kristi	Excellent stay
1367	125397657	42740	109470420	Joyce	Julie gave great directions and instructions. The home is pretty clean and was perfect for our stay in NY. 
1367	127842878	42756	24191146	Aurianna	Julie's place was great! Lots of space for multiple people staying! Huge pull out futons! Also there is a back yard/ balcony so during the summer that would be amazing! :) Everything was super clean and it was just what I needed! Check in was super easy and I never had to converse with anyone! I would highly recommend this place and Astoria is great!   
1367	128102705	42757	25392752	Jason	This is the definition of utilitarian. It provides everything you need, nothing you don't and is a great value. Parking is relatively easy to find on weekend nights, not so much during the day. Great location and lots of sleeping area. 
1367	128295435	42758	112079360	Kenneth	Close to the train station but you have to find a parking spot on the street and it's very hard 
1367	129202962	42764	94563056	Caleb	Nice place to stay. Close to the train, and about a 25 minute ride to manhattan
1367	135319722	42798	48808478	Albertina	Clean and convenient!!! 
537	49272355	42279	43679047	Ellison	Wonderful experience , nice host, nice sea view.good communication.thank you Grace.

12333	49302013	42279	316286	Jason	clean, courteous & cordial. I had an awesome taco at Taco Mix a few blocks away. 
12333	49413205	42280	3070441	Laura Norcia	Jeffery was great, very accommodating considering I booked a room with him at the last minute. Room was sufficient for a quick overnight stay in East Harlem. Loved the neighborhood and was so convenient to the 6 subway. Thanks again Jeffery for helping me out!!
12333	50013832	42285	41939513	Cynthia	I was running late but Jeffrey was really good about it and left me a key to get in. It wasn't too much later when he got back and showed me around. He made me feel welcome and told me about the place. I was super happy to have an elevator for this 5th floor apartment. It was also a half a block from the subway. I felt relatively safe in this neighborhood and didn't have trouble parking or moving my car for street cleaning.
12333	52239091	42304	29054297	Julia	La estadÃ­a en la casa de Jeffrey fue totalmente excelente! Un espacio muy lindo y cÃ³modo, luminoso y organizado, junto con la cocina completamente equipada y cÃ³moda!La habitacion privada tambien muy linda, cÃ³moda, limpia y luminosa. Todo funcionando perfecto, WiFi disponible, televisor, equipo de mÃºsica. El baÃ±o sin ningun problema, una ducha muy agradable!Gracias Jeffrey! Fue un gusto haber estado en tu casa!
12333	55113079	42336	2893760	Carolyn	Jeffrey was really awesome and patient with us, as we had just stumbled into New York City for Thanksgiving. He was readily available by phone and text to help us figure out where we needed to go.The apartment itself is lovely! It is very well-kept, and on the inside of the building, making it a bit quieter than expected. We didn't have any trouble sleeping at all.There were no safety issues for us walking around the neighborhood at night at all. We asked for directions a couple times, and people were really, really helpful and kind.
12333	55527822	42339	34101336	Johanna	My boyfriend and I stayed in the flat for four nights. The pictures are accurate and the flat, as a whole, is quite cozy. Unfortunately, the bed wasnt made and sheets not fresh. The two roommates were not informed about us coming so it created a bit of confusion. However, we could reach Jeffrey (who was not there in person) over the phone and everything turned out well . 'Free Parking on Premises' is parking in the streets, but was no problem. Overall Jeffrey was always reachable, quickly answered all my questions and was concerned about our well-being. 
12333	55701713	42342	36894701	Jenna	I didn't actually meet Jeffrey but he was very responsive to me and checked in after I arrived. The apartment was as described in the listing - clean and sufficient. The building was a little rundown. This a was a good option for a quick overnight stay.
12333	56598567	42353	45558349	Lilibet	If you are looking for a place close to the subway and you don't mind the apt being dirty this is the place to go. The pictures don't do it justice, the bathroom was extremely dirty and the floors too. The rule of the apt was to take off shoes at the entrance so you don't bring in the dirt but it's  worse inside than what you can bring in. Also, I had spoken with the host a few times prior to my arrival letting him know of the arrival and departure times and he said no problem that he was going to be at the apt when we arrived. The day before my trip he sent an email telling me that there was a guest that was leaving the day I arrived so that check-in would have to be at noon instead of 10am. After that he sent me another email the day I arrived saying that check-in would have to be closer to 1pm because he was running a bit late. By then I had already spent 2hrs and a half walking with my luggage through Harlem. When I was finally able to go in the apt everything was super dirty so I don't know why the check-in was so late if he definitely didn't clean. I'm for sure not staying there again. I wish I could upload pictures so you would be able to see the black rim of the tub. Aside from the dirt and the elevator taking forever to reach the 5 floor there's really nothing else wrong with the place. My first impression of the area was scary and dingy but as the days went by it was less scary because I knew how to get around. The host is nice, he was there all the time but I didn't mind because I was gone the whole day. Hope the review helps the next guest when making the decision of where to stay. 
12333	57314503	42362	35820454	Yoo Jin	It was really great to meet Jeffrey! He was really nice and was always willing to help with anything we needed. The room was cozy and was as described online. Everything was great, it was kind of tricky to find a parking space in which we didn't have to move the car every day. If you are planning on bringing a car, try to get there early to find close by parking space. But in all, it was a great experience! 
12333	58351039	42371	28428216	Patrick	"Jeffrey was very welcoming and meant it when he said ""mi casa es su casa"". He gave us advice on what to do and where to eat, which was much appreciated. The apartment is located steps away from a subway stop as well as a $1 pizza slice place! His place was very clean and he provided clean towels and sheets. Our only issue was that he smoked inside, which I was allergic to. Would stay here again."
12333	62027308	42410	44762647	Elisea	Great host!! Jeffery is super nice and welcoming! The apartment was super clean and looks like the pictures..has a great location near central park and few steps away from the 6 train! You definitely  will have a good time here! 
12333	62588965	42415	42385411	Johnny	Great experience to stay with Jeffrey. He was very welcoming and friendly. The apartment is fairly close to the subway station and the room was nice and clean. 
12333	75285970	42510	58885286	Macarena	Muy lindo y gran apartamento! Con excelentes comodidades y wifi!! El primer dÃ­a estaba sucio pero enseguida vino una chica amorosa a limpiar. Jeffrey se mantuvo en contacto siempre y a dispocion!! Precio calidad muy buena! VolverÃ­a encantada!!
12333	75718958	42512	1223048	Myles	Jeffrey's place was great! Had a spacious living room and three totally nice bedrooms! East Harlem has character, but it's fine! Would definitely rent here again! 
12333	90365948	42582	62183261	Zubair	Jeffrey was very responsive whenever I contacted him which was somewhat reassuring. However, there is minimal upkeep of the apt itself (the weekly cleaner that was supposed to come in, never did) and since the entire apartment is completely occupied by Airbnb guests, many areas of the apartment are left uncleaned for extended periods of time. The room itself was in decent shape, relatively clean and air conditioned, so no complaints there. Overall a manageable apartment, although far from ideal.

31419	132041819	42781	5641160	Mark	I had the honor of being Danny's first Air BnB guest. Since this is a new endeavor for him and the family, I encourage the next guest(s) to review their expectations prior to booking to insure everyone's satisfaction. Notes: Entry is up a long set of front steps. The room included a microwave and min-fridge.The bed and linens were quite beautiful and comfortable. The guest(s) has access to a powder room across the hall and shares the upstairs full bath with the family.
31419	136596341	42805	99803988	Frank	Danny and family are very warm and friendly, the room is plenty spacious and the bed is soft and comfortable.  I really enjoyed getting to meet and spend some time with everyone.  Check in was smooth and easy and everything was where it was supposed to be.  Always felt very welcome, but was free to come and go without incident.Location is great, just minutes from several major highways making it very easy to get in and out of the Bronx by car to Queens, LI, Manhattan or Westchester.My son joined me at the end of my visit and we took advantage of the location to visit City Island, which is only a short drive from Danny's neighborhood.This would be a great base location for a NY Yankees or Mets baseball weekend. 
13687	4764991	41418	5709312	Tania	Thank you Lucy for being so helpful and accommodating. I really felt at home here and love the area as so close to bars/restaurants in East Village/Alphabet City.I would recommend this apartment as its extremely clean, roomy and comfortable and having full use of one of the bathrooms made this an excellent airbnb experience.I would strongly recommend.
13687	4816968	41421	6205803	Priscilla	Lucy and her boyfriend are great hosts. The apartment is very modern and clean. The room is spacious with plenty of extra space to put your luggage and things. You get to use a private bathroom, which is really clean and stocked with things like towels, shampoos, conditioners and hair dryer. The bed is incredibly comfortable too. Lucy takes effort to make her guests comfortable and she does an amazing job. Location was great too, it's really easy to get around lower manhattan. I highly recommend this. 
13687	4913568	41426	894376	Jc	Lucy is the ideal host.  Very friendly and chill. She has a beautiful modern apartment- very tastefully decorated, spacious and clean.  Several bus lines right outside the door.  Elevator and AC- with your own bathroom.  Skip the hotel and stay with a real NY'er.  Her poodle is also the sweetest little thing.
13687	5042479	41434	922326	Amanda	Lucy and Brenden were very accommodating and the room was well appointed, clean, and comfy! You have your own bathroom which is also very nice. Lucy was friendly and left us umbrellas to use and was very sweet. Thanks to both of you for making us welcome! 
13687	5121476	41438	6470973	Cathy&Steve	Nous avons Ã©tÃ© vraiment bien reÃ§u!! Lucy et Brandon sont trÃ¨s sympa et arrangeant, on a pu rÃ©cupÃ©rer les clefs de l'appartement dÃ¨s notre arrivÃ©e Ã  NYC et pu laisser nos bagages tard la journÃ©e de notre dÃ©part. L'appartement est magnifique, la chambre est spacieuse avec une vue imprenable. Le petit plus Ã©tant d'avoir sa propre salle de bain avec serviette et produit de base. Le quartier est gÃ©nial, pleins de petits cafÃ©s, bars et restos Ã  proximitÃ©. Il y a Ã©galement des parcs et boutiques en direction du mÃ©tro. A refaire ! 
13687	5167687	41441	6682462	Jules	Our experience at Lucy's was absolutely great! We went out for beers shortly after getting there, Lucy and Branden made us feel so welcome. If you want to live for a few days in East Village, this is the place you should go to. I strongly recommend Lucy's place to anyone who wants to stay in a very comfortable and neat room in a great location with amazing hosts!
13687	5221855	41443	4504808	Nicola	Beautiful apartment in a fun part of town. The fact that you are in the city but don't feel like you are is a bonus to me. Lots of cafes, restaurants, bars, shops etc within walking distance and then there's the L train which takes you right into Union or across into Brooklyn where there is fun a plenty to be had.Thanks Lucy...maybe I'll see you again!!
13687	5267772	41446	6180485	Etienne & Cyrielle & CÃ´me	Lucy and her dog ( Trinity) was really kind and helpful with us. The flat is very clean with a good situation. Lucy give us chinese food from her mother, that's was really good. Thanks Lucy. There is bike station near the flat. Bye Bye. Etienne and Cyrielle
13687	5403377	41453	3221279	Clarissa	nice spot. great location. clean. very hospitable. 
13687	5465195	41456	180061	Hermosa	Good place to stay near subway and city bikes station. Would definitely stay here again. 
13687	5755257	41470	6643673	Erin	The home of Lucy Han is beautiful.  Clean and spacious.  Our room and private bath were awesome!  The Lucy and her boyfriend were wonderful hosts.  The location was great for us.  There is a beautiful rooftop terrace that provides amazing views of the city and the sunset at night breathtaking.  This is a place I would highly recommend Lucy's place.  This was our first time using Airbnb and forgot about the checkout time (sorry Lucy) which was our mistake.  Its easy to not be in the hotel mode when you are staying at a comfortable home like we did!
13687	5848634	41474	7028882	Mette	Our stay with Lucy and Brenden was great! Really lovely room with a comfortable bed and everything was nice and clean. The view from the apartment roof is awesome and both hosts were so helpfull with info about the city. The location is also great because of the quiet neighboorhood. Would definately recommend to everyone!
13687	6028250	41482	6682546	Martha	Our stay with Lucy was nice. Lucy and her boyfriend gave us enough information on how to enjoy NYC. Lucy was also help me to arrange my luggage delivery since Delta Airlines messed up with my luggage from Atlanta to NYC. The room is nice, the private bathroom is the highlight. In overall I enjoy my stay there.I also love the neighborhood, lots of cafes and restaurants around. My highlight was the Cuban Resto next door and coffee shop called Ninth Espresso...
13687	6303055	41493	5212522	Chris And Tiffanie	Our stay with Lucy and Brenden was great!! The apartment is beautiful--very modern, spacious and clean. Our bedroom was the perfect size and the private bathroom was perfect. Lucy and Brenden were great hosts, who welcomed us with a cold beer when we arrived! They were really friendly and easy to talk to and gave us some good tips on their musts and favourite spots in NY. The location was great too and we loved exploring Alphabet city and LES. We would highly recommend their apartment and would definitely return to stay! :) Thanks Lucy and Brenden!

13687	6429356	41498	5974832	Lucile	We had a really nice 4nights-stay at lucy's appartment! Room and bathroom were very convenient and we have been nicely greeted by Lucy and her boyfriend.On the top, the appartment is well located, just 2 blocks from the subway, and we can easily get either Manhattan (north or south) or Brooklyn.By the way NYC is magic!!!
13687	6557839	41503	6937073	Mirko	It was very nice to stay at Lucys calm and clean Apartment. She was a very kind and helpful  host. East Village is a nice and authentic place to spend your holidays in NY. We can recommend Lucy.
13687	6686474	41507	2623518	Alejandro	We had a very good time in NYC. The 4 days we stayed at Lucy's place made the perfect  complement. The apartment was very well maintained  and modern and the location very good. The bus stops right in front of the main entrance and takes you to the metro in 5 minutes. Lucy and her boyfriend were very polite and respectful with us at all times.  If I come back to NY I will certainly talk to Lucy. 
13687	6940489	41517	121033	Miranda	I only stayed with Lucy for 2 nights, the apartment was really lovely and in the perfect location. Would definitely recommend this spot in NYC. 
13687	7808415	41551	7702482	Joan	The apartment was very lovely.  My room was quite nice and the bed was very comfortable. Lucy and Brendan were friendly and I fell in love with their poodle Trinity.  The bathroom was well equipped and the building is quite new and well maintained. The view in the roof was spectacular. I highly recommend their apartment as a great place to stay when in New York City.  
13687	7914601	41555	7486304	Jonah	Arrived mid afternoon on Friday. After a little shopping we arrived at Lucy and Brendan's place. What a lovely apartment in a perfect location. The apartment was clean, spacious and exactly as described. Great view from the roof top patio. The pictures you see on airbnb are accurate, including the view from the patio.Lucy and Brenda were quiet, we never saw them... of course we spent most of our timing out and exploring all over NYC.I would definitely recommend Lucy's apartment to anyone. In fact, after having stayed as some fairly miserable hotels in NYC I can without a doubt say that this stay was tops!My only single minor complaint is that it can be tricky to get a cab on Avenue C. We walked up to 14th, about 2 minutes away, and it was much easier.Thank you Lucy and Brendan.
13687	8402572	41576	7556516	Hilary	Lucy and Brendan are very sweet and genuine people; they were so amazing to me during my stay. They were very accommodating and informative upon my arrival. They gave me a key to come and go as I please. As well, their apartment is a dream, it was wonderful to have my own room and separate bathroom. I would definitely stay with them again and would refer/suggest them to anyone who wants a real NY experience.
13687	8582046	41584	7220713	Hezy	Nice and clean apartment. During my stay Lucy and her boyfriend Brendan tried to keep my privacy. For the truth I hardly met them at the apt.If you like a lot of privacy in a quiet place not far from the metro station, it does make the work.
13687	8713159	41591	7995447	Emma	Lucy and Brendan were great hosts! They have a beautiful apartment and are very close to local shops, cafÃ©s, restaurants and bars with the metro train only a 10 min walk away. Their apartment is clean, spacious and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable and the private bathroom was such a bonus plus they provided towels and toiletries. They have the cutest poodle called Trinity who you will just fall in love with. Would definitely recommend staying with them in the future! 
13687	8814267	41597	176253	Marco & Talita	Lucy and her boyfried were amazing hosts. Even with our special requests, like testing an PS4 at their TV, they were aways supportive and polite. The location is good and the room and the bathroom was clean and confortable, the bed and the linens were top quality and we had plenty of space at the closets. I would stay with them again.
13687	9315695	41629	8700583	Claire	Lucy and Brendan's apartment was quiet, spacious and clean.  Heating was appreciated during the cold chilly days. The bed was so comfortable that we ended up sleeping in more than we wanted to!  Could not hear the neighbours in the apartment. Lucy and Brendan were friendly and very easy going and we could come and go as we pleased.  Convenient location from which to explore Manhattan - lots of variety in restaurants, supermarkets nearby and only a short walk to the L train.  Appreciated their tips on local places to eat and where to find tourist landmarks.  We felt safe in this neighbourhood and would gladly return to the East Village and their lovely apartment anytime.  Thanks again.  
13687	9366662	41632	9111275	Christy	It was wonderful staying at Lucy and Brendan's apartment.  Their apartment was located conveniently to all the neat places in East Village, and was easily accessible to all places especially since the bus stop was literally front of their building.  The room was clean and comfortable, and enjoyed having the private bathroom to use during our stay. My husband and I would totally stay again at their place, and thanks again for the accommodation and flexibility! 
13687	10363857	41686	1896595	Annabelle	The flat was really nice. The bedroom and the bathroom are roomy enough. Trinity is really a nice dog, so funny!
13687	10429453	41688	2169295	Angad	The apartment was really nice and well kept. It looks exactly like the pictures, and was really comfortable for us! East Village is a great place to stay for a vacation in New York. The house is about a 10 minute walk from the Subway station but it's not too bad.It seemed like Lucy was quite nice to the other guests who were in the house before us. She let them leave their bags in the house past check-in and seemed to have gotten to know them quite well. However, for some reason, she didn't let us leave our bags at her place past checkout. She also made a big deal out of giving us the keys in the morning, even though she was already awake and as were the guests who were in the house before us. The noise incident she described in the review for us sounds fictional since we definitely went out of our way to not disturb anyone. Just for the record, we were there for a holiday weekend and we didn't know that coming home late would be a problem.All in all, the apartment is beautiful and well located. Lucy seems to be a nice person but for some reason she seemed to have something against us.
13687	10618152	41698	11086758	Anna	Lucy and Brendan's home is exactly like the pictures with a little poodle called Trinity (who is absolutely adorable and very quiet. She won't bother you at all and knows not to come in the room).The apartment is very clean with an amazing location. One block behind their apartment is filled with cafes, restaurants and grocery stores. The street is also amazingly quiet for NY. We had the best sleep during our two week NY stay at their place. They have an open kitchen and let us use whatever we needed - including their washer and dryer which was very appreciated.As per their house rules, they like quiet guests but don't mind how late or early you get in. They also recommended fabulous places to eat and a great Broadway show - Sleep No More.Transport - so very convenient to hop off the bus and walk 2 metres to your door step! The closet subway is a short bus ride away or about a 15min walk. We walked this most days as it's a lovely walk with lots of food on the way. Lucy and Brendan let us stay longer after their checkout time with very short notice which was very kind of them. I contacted Lucy one morning and she was very responsive. She made sure we were as comfortable as possible.By far the best experience of our trip. We would book here again without a doubt. Worth noting the bed is also ridiculously comfortable. 
13687	11300225	41727	11904025	Hanno	It was a nice stay at Lucys and Brendans home and their little dog Trinity. Everything was very clean. I can totally recommend to stay there for a while.
13687	11536991	41736	9920595	Marga	We had a great stay at Lucy's!They were very welcoming, the room was really clean, nice neighbourhood, friendly dog, not to far from the bus or subway... only pluses.Due to our own schedule we only stayed for two nights, but we would definitley stay here again!
13687	11794765	41744	12020900	(EMAIL HIDDEN)	We are 100% satisfied with the room we booked. Lucy and Brendan were very patient for our arrival, as our flight was 5 hours delay, so they stayed home all day to wait us! The appartement, bedroom and bathroom are very clean. They gave us a key and we were very independant to go out and come back, no matter what Time it was. We tried our best to be quiet and respectful, and we had the same attitude in return, so no doubt that if we want to come back to NY, we will go to Lucy and Brendan appartement. Moreover, they are located in East Village, which we really enjoyed. Near from all the restaurants and bars, but far enought to sleep well without noise! Really good place, good people, good holidays, I recommend!Sabrina.
13687	11952378	41749	12200132	Tabitha	my bf and i enjoyed our stay at Lucy's! The room was clean, location was good, with the bus and subways pretty close by! Will definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a fuss free stay.
13687	12148116	41753	11444352	Julie	The apartment is 10 minutes from subway in Alphabet City / East Village. The room, is as it looks like on the picture : nice, modern, clean and the private bathroom is nice too with hair drier, shampoos and conditioners.However it was very complicated at the very beginning to meet with our hosts. We wanted to arrive by 11.00 am but it was not possible ; then after few emails we proposed to go to the luggage service store to accommodate. Suddenly, it became possible to arrive at 11.30 am.This may be the reason why we had a very special welcome : Lucy kept on repeating how she wanted to accommodate all her guests, insisting on our will to come too early and how sad she was about the previous guests, who were very kind and niceâ?¦.Then, during 4 days, she never saluted us, nor even said a word unless the last day to give us the luggage service store in an aggressive manner.Another weird thing is that she insisted, when we arrived, on the fact that we should not say to other people in the block that we were there by airbnb but that we were friends.
13687	12425029	41761	1632788	Patrick	Very nice apartment, really clean and well kept.  the neighborhood feels safe also. 10 mins by feet for the first subway, which is ok. Hosts will give you plenty of privacy. Overall very good experience if you are used to a private room in an apartment with other people.
13687	12743372	41769	12661063	Romain	Super plan cette location!Lucy et son mari sont trÃ¨s attentionnÃ©s et accueillants, la chambre est trÃ¨s bien (trÃ¨s bon lit), la salle de bain parfaite. Trinity, leur chien, est un amour.C'est la location parfaite pour recharger les batteries aprÃ¨s les longues journÃ©es New Yorkaises.Super facile de rayonner dans tout Manhattan grace au metro (Union Square Ã  proximitÃ©).on a jamais eu Ã  prendre le taxi! Le quartier d'Alphabet City et plus largement East Village sont vraiment parfait pour sortir/manger, les balades sont multiples. Ã§a fait du bien de respirer hors de Midtown et hors des foules de touristes!Foncez
13687	13503784	41788	1136773	Laura	We had a great experience at Lucy's apartment! The place was very clean and spacious and Lucy and Brenden were so friendly and welcoming. We loved the neighborhood - close to bus/subway transportation, close to a walking/biking trail by the water and tons and tons of restaurants within walking distance. Would definitely recommend!
13687	15734966	41834	17377265	Katrina	Lucy and Brendan were very friendly people and their dog Trinity was very nice. They were accommodating, helpful and check in went all according to the plan. The place was nice and clean. The location was perfect with lots of nice restaurants in the neighborhood and close to the subway. I would definately recommend it to everyone! 
13687	17281059	41861	16816945	Marte	We stayed four nights at Lucy's place and were very satisfied. We had a little rough start as we arrived later than she asked us to (11:15 pm on a workday) due to flight delay, customs and the super shuttle, but she stayed up a little longer and then was very accomodating when we arrived. We didn't have much interaction afterwards as she and her fiance Brad left in the morning before we got up and worked late at night. Both were nice people though and gave us advice about what to do in NY and on our later travelling through the east coast and Canada. The room itself had a nice size with a large enough bed for the two of us. It was clean, tidy and nicely decorated. The private bathroom was very nice as well. Definitively a recommendation to people who want a nice place to stay in NY and not too much interaction with the hosts.
13687	17573553	41865	17995444	Ian	We stayed three nights with Lucy and Brendan and had a great time. They were friendly and gave us tips on how to get around NYC from their apartment and places to see, but also gave us plenty of privacy. The place was clean and tidy and the location was great (about 10 mins' walk to the nearest subway but there is a bus stop right outside). Would definitely recommend to other people!
13687	18057126	41872	4253586	Harm	We had a great in NY! The apartment is very nice! Highly recommend :)! 
13687	19461984	41895	12574113	Vera	Lucy and Brendan were easy going, friendly, helpful, really welcoming. Their dog Trinity was adorable.The apartment was spacious, we had a lot of privacy due to separate bathroom. Our room was clean, quiet, comfy... we were really satisfied, but the most perfect thing about this accommodation is the roof-deck! We were out all day running the city, so we couldn't imagine better chill out than six-pack on this beautiful place in the evening. The neighborhood was nice, lots of restaurants, close to subway (bus right in front of the building...). We definitely enjoyed our stay and next time we would choose this place again.Highly recommended!!! :) Thank you Lucy and Brendan!
13687	19809663	41900	7704743	Analia	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
13687	20281522	41909	15187320	Pierre	Appartement tel que sur les photos.Ligne de mÃ©tro Ã  10 min a pied.Accueil de Lucy trÃ¨s sympa.Pas de souci pour le check in et le check out.Je conseille !!
13687	20607903	41914	19788541	Kirsten	We've stayed with Lucy and Brandon for 5 nights. The apartment is great and the location is good, about three blocks away from the subway. The room and bathroom were clean and we had a good time staying here. The hospitality is good although we did have some discussion with Lucy. Unfortunately, in our opinion, Lucy is not the easiest person to deal with. But in the end this did not affect our stay.
13687	21583313	41932	20030375	Lydia	We had a great stay at Lucy and Brendan's place. The bedroom and bathroom were clean and comfortable. Excellent location for sightseeing in Manhattan. And Lucy had some good tips on what not to miss in NYC. Trinity the dog was really quiet and cute. All in all a very good experience!
13687	21784324	41936	3686739	Leanna	We had a wonderful stay with Lucy and her little dog Trinity! The apartment, our room and bathroom were all very clean and comfortable. Communication was very simple and check in and out was a breeze! The location was great as well! Easy to catch public transit into the city and get to where we needed to go. We would definitely stay here again in the future.
13687	22061333	41941	10204955	Anne Sophie	Pas de surprise : un appartement trÃ¨s bien situÃ©, propre et conforme aux descriptions. Nos hÃ´tes nous ont trÃ¨s bien accueillis. Un trÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour Ã  New York.
13687	22172138	41943	22044948	Emma	Lucy and Brandon were fantastic! This was our first experience with airbnb and we were delighted. The apartment was large, bright, clean and in a  great Manhattan location. Brandon was extremely helpful with information regarding the city and the apartment was lovely and quiet and nice. Our stay was during the week so they of course they were intensely working so we didn't see much of each other as we were out touring as well. We were able to get some much needed peaceful rest to tour yet another day. Thank you so much!
13687	22487160	41951	14231113	Jean-Charles	Lucy and Brendan were excellent hosts, friendly and very helpful. The room is as described and shown on the pics which means great !!The bed is very confortable and the room is spacious.The location is also very good, St Marks Place can be reach in 5 minutes (walking distance) and you also have a nice restaurants and bars in the neighbourhood. There is also an amazing view from the roof top.We really enjoyed our stay there and we highly recommend it.Thanks to have made our stay in NYC such a good one.JC
13687	22792540	41958	13962267	Mathieu	L'appartement est trÃ¨s bien, tel que sur les photos. SituÃ© dans east village qui regorge de petits resto et de bars sympas.  Parfait pour dÃ©couvrir NYC Ã  10 min Ã  peine de la ligne L. Bon accueil de Lucy et Brandon
13687	22960058	41961	12332684	Jessica	Lucy's apartment is in a really convenient location for visiting/shopping on the lower east side. Having a private bathroom is a plus but the shower curtain needs to replaced (mildewed). We also felt rushed the morning of our departure as we had to turn in the key by 7 am, meaning that we had to take our luggage to breakfast before heading to the airport. It was a bit uncomfortable that we were asked to be especially quiet in the evening hours, but overall it was an alright experience.
13687	23242806	41969	7273737	Anna	Ein super schÃ¶nes Zimmer in einer guten Lage. Ideal fÃ¼r einen Kurztrip nach NY. 
13687	23545506	41977	21369998	Mirjam	The room was cleen, the dog was cute and both hosts were fine. Just make sure you are quiet and every thing will be ok.
13687	23745646	41982	22057824	Xiao	Lucy and her husband made sure that we know how to get around town and provided some information. We didn't see much of them because they were working a lot. Their dog is lovely. The apartment is nice,  across the street there is a supermarket and also buses which take you to the closest subway station in 5 minutes. The area is pretty safe. 
13687	23878988	41986	10685893	Iryna	Lucy and her husband were great hosts! The apartment was very special and clean and the bed was wonderful. I loved how sunny it was in the mornings (there are big shades if you don't do sun in the mornings) and the sunrise was breathtaking. Their little dog is very cute too. Thanks again!
13687	24133581	41994	4999743	Christina	Nice place in an interesting and diverse neighborhood. The welcome was friendly at first, Brendan and Lucy gave us lots of information about restaurants and sights. I expected us to get along well, we tried to respect the couples' needs (being respectful, not slamming the doors, not leaving the fridge open (I am sorry that it happened once), not leaving doors open etc.). Unfortunately, after a few days, I felt the atmosphere changing. Lucy did not say a word when we came home in the evening. The present I brought from home was not acknowledged once. When we were sitting in the dining area one night whilst Lucy was watching TV she asked as not to talk too loud. When I replied that it might have been due to the high TV volume she suggested we should go to our room (10:30 p.m.). Altogether, I did not feel comfortable anymore and was sad because I could not understand what had happened. Some other guests described similar experiences before. I did not attach too much importance to these comments since the hosts make perfectly clear that a respectful and calm behavior is vital to them. But, as far as I can tell, we tried our best to do so and still it did not work out. We stayed more than a week and paid more than 1000 Dollars to Lucy and Brendan. I don't expect to make new friends via AirBnB, but neither do I expect a hostile atmosphere. Lucy made me feel like we should not be at her place at all. In the evenings, we tried to come home late (but before 11 p.m.) and to eat out to avoid unpleasant meetings. It seems perfectly understandable that having lots of guests around at home could be disturbing, but 1.) this is not my issue being a polite and paying guest and 2.) this behavior does not make it any better. It is so unnecessary. Surely I will come back to the city but I would not feel comfortable to stay here again nor would I recommend it to friends. 
13687	24996647	42008	5438318	Dave	Brendan and Lucy are wonderful hosts!  My 20 year old son and his girlfriend stayed with them and were very complimentary of their apartment and personal care. Apartment: large, well laid out with private room and bath. Very beautiful and a terrific location. Hosts: the Han's made sharing an apartment a great experience. Highly recommended. 
13687	48574753	42274	13069553	RenÃ©	Lucy and Brendan were great hosts and made us feel very welcome in their home. We were not there often as we were out and about in the city.Room and bathroom were clean and spacious. Rooftop terrace with an awesome view of the city. They provided us with some quick pointers and tips on the area regarding transportation and meals.Public transportation:Bus stop is right in front of their apartment and closest metro station is a 4 block walk, but we never felt uncomfortable walking in the area even at late night. Also Citi Bikes are available nearby.I would definitely try to stay with them again during a future trip to NYC.Thanks again Lucy and Brendan 
13687	49079049	42277	26266636	Anna	Lucy and Brendan were great hosts and very welcoming.  Their apartment is a great location for exploring the city. Close to the subway and bus stops.  The room was very comfortable and clean and they very kindly left out maps and guides for our stay.  They were also very kind in accepting our booking quite last minute. We would highly recommend to others.
13687	49526484	42281	29659683	Julie	They were welcoming and helpful hosts - willing to offer us suggestions whenever we asked! We were comfortable and taken care of, and we still had plenty of time for our own personal space with our own room and private bathroom. They provided several suggestions for places to eat and see around the area. The place was clean and had enough space, and it was a calm environment. Don't worry, the dog is calm and was barely noticed. The place is a short walk to the metro station and they had a bus stop directly across the street if you'd prefer it instead. The roof top access is a nice touch for a little getaway as you gaze upon the Manhattan skyline - a must if you stay there!
13687	51035541	42294	22470201	Cinzia	The apartament is clean, confortable and quite. The owners are friendly and really kind. Very suggested!
13687	51761334	42301	17776171	Dimitri	very nice apartment in a very quiet and clean building.room with queen bed and very very sweet line, clean bathroom, amazing view from the roof. no surprise...the M14D bus is really usefull accross the street and you can be at union square in 10 minutes. good location.lucy, brandon and trinity are nice and quiet.
13687	52274935	42304	46101170	Lin	Lucy is super nice! We took a red-eye flight from SFO to New York. Lucy was very kind and allowed us to check in early to take a rest before we headed out. She also gave us a lot of recommendations on what to do, see and eat around the neighborhood. The room is spacious and clean. We love that it comes with a private bath. 
13687	52862419	42310	17851570	Elisa	Lucy and Brendan were very welcoming, as well as Trinity! (their dog) The bedroom and bath was very clean and they gave us awesome recommendations for food and drinks, as well as information on how to get around everywhere. We did not stay at the apartment as much because we were out most of the time exploring. The bed is super comfortable and it was nice having a separate bathroom for privacy. We were also able to leave our luggage after check out because our flight was late in the afternoon, thank you Lucy and Brendan!
13687	55939322	42345	9431944	Riley	Great stay. Good location, safe short walk to subway, with bars and restaurants in walking distance also. Clean and quiet with lots of privacy. Great to have your own bathroom. Very nice people. Would stay there again. 
13687	61337244	42402	981362	John	Such a great place! Spacious room and very comfortable, well-kept, clean.  The separate bathroom, while not directly joined to the room, was the main selling point - such a luxury to have in a NY apt :)  Good location too, we had a nice walk to the east village and downtown, so much better staying in this area than navigating the din of midtown while just waking up, haha.
13687	67259793	42456	2177801	Amanda	Very nice apartment, perfectly located in East Village. The bedroom was bright and spacious and the bathroom was nice and clean. We did not meet Lucy and her partner much but they were very kind and lent us their museum card. An extra plus for the cute dog. Highly recommended!
13687	69220421	42470	35583794	Traci	Lucy and Brendan were great hosts and very accommodating.  Our flight arrived late and they were nice enough to stay up and wait for us to arrive :). They had a lot of great recommendations of things to do in the city.  The room was very nice with a comfy bed after a long day walking around in the city!  The separate but private bath was an added plus.  Great experience and location!  Would definitely stay again!

13687	71659406	42487	16027209	Shira	Lucy and Brendan were fantastic. They enthusiastically greeted us and were eager to help us make the most of our trip with a prepared package of local maps plus recommended restaurant and bars. The location was perfect for accessing all parts of the city with very close bus stops and a 10 minute walk to the L train. The apartment was tidy, bed and pillows were super comfy, and we had all the space and storage we needed. Would absolutely stay here again!
13687	71957038	42490	23327124	Sophia	Excellent accueil des hÃ´tes Lucy et Brandon. Emplacement trÃ¨s pratique Ã  East Village. Appartement trÃ¨s propre! Bien dÃ©corÃ©. Lucy met Ã  disposition plusieurs serviettes de bain, produits hygiÃ©niques. Les hÃ´tes sont amicaux, respectueux de l'intimitÃ©. J'ai adorÃ© ce lieu et y retournerais avec plaisir. 
13687	72989097	42496	70023550	Arushi	Thanks Lucy and co. For a fun easy stay!
13687	74191388	42503	51516504	Bianca	El departamento es muy lindo, y cÃ³modo. El barrio es aceptable, no es uno de los mejores barrios de Nueva York, algo a destacar es que tiene varios medios de transporte a su alrededor.La dueÃ±a del departamento fue muy cÃ¡lida a la hora de recibirnos, pero hubo ciertas situaciones incÃ³modas durante el transcurso de nuestra estadÃ­a. Un punto negativo, es que a la hora de querer utilizar la cocina, por ej, siendo esta una herramienta ofrecida por la dueÃ±a desde un principio, al momento de querer utilizarla no estuvo a gusto con esta acciÃ³n. 
13687	75203216	42509	66584484	Zimeng	Lucy is the best Airbnb host I have ever seen! She was very friendly and enthusiastic from the day one and she responded all my questions patiently.  I love their artistically designed condo, it's neat and comfortable to stay, I would definitely recommend my friends to stay with Lucy if they want to experience Manhattan neighborhood. 
13687	75460247	42511	48421025	Ben	A nice 2b2b apartment located in the trendy east village that is walking distance to many bars and restaurants, there are a lot of good Japanese restaurants within a 5-10minute walk....the apartment is located on the 9th floor with access to the gorgeous rooftop overlooking downtown and midtown, such an awesome perk, our room and bathroom was clean and free of any bugs...you have your own a/c in the bedroom although we did not have to use it during that time, it's a pretty big room facing the street with a queen size bed and plenty of closet space, bath towels, hair dryer, shampoos and bar soaps are provided, if your looking for body wash bring your own, overall we had a pleasant stayOne particular problem we had was trying to meet up with Lucy to get our house keys, it was a struggle texting back and forth trying to align our schedules, at one point I thought she was going to cancel our reservations, quite a few times we had to keep changing the times to meet and it was frustrating considering that we had to carry out luggage around Manhattan, our texting got a little heated but thankful things worked out in the end 
13687	75872111	42513	6443808	Elena	The apartment couldn't be better situated. Awesome and authentic Manhattan neighborhood with many cool places around.Lucy and Brandon were nice and very helpful recommending places in the city. Their little dog Trinity makes the house joyful.
13687	77362526	42521	2464714	Jop	We had a great stay! Lucy and Brendan were fantastic hosts, the room was very nice (we had our own bathroom) and well-kept, and the appartment is perfectly located just east of Tompkins Square Park in the East Village (there's even a  rooftop with an amazing view of Manhattan). Highly recommended!
13687	81129447	42542	41881593	Ruchi	We had a pleasant stay. The room is a good size and is conveniently located. Lucy and Brendan offered useful tips and had a guide for their area which we used. Trinity, their dog, is not only adorable but really quiet too! 
13687	82019720	42547	21055829	AmÃ©lie	L'appartement est tout Ã  fait charmant, la chambre est agrÃ©able, la salle de bain trÃ¨s propre et le salon trÃ¨s lumineux!!Lucy et son mari sont absolument adorables et trÃ¨s serviables! Ils nous ont indiquÃ© de supers endroits, nous ont aidÃ© pour trouver des places pour un match de baseball et pour une comÃ©die musicale, ils ont fait tout le nÃ©cessaire pour nous aider!!!East Village est un quartier super, avec plein de bars et de restos, et loin du tulmute touristique de Times square! L'appartement est un tout petit peu loin du mÃ©tro, mais largement faisable! On a passÃ© un super moment Ã  New York et en grande partie grÃ¢ce Ã  Lucy et son mari!! Ã? recommander fortement!!!
13687	84136906	42556	6578103	Jules	My boyfriend and I spent 5 nights at Lucy and Brendan's apartment which was very clean and well kept. It is exactly as advertised in the photos and also offered a lovely rooftop space with fab NYC skyline views which was a great bonus. Lucy and Brendan kindly included a guide with great restaurant and bar recommendations and the bathroom was stocked with amenities - really nice touches.Although we really have nothing bad to say about the apartment, I cannot say that this was the most welcoming of stays. We arrived 45min later than originally stated (arriving at 11.15pm) due to a flight delay, and received a couple of overly assertive and quite frosty text messages from Lucy. She explained she had work the next day. Although we turned up at the flat 5 minutes after that message was sent, Lucy did not meet with us, however Brendan kindly showed us around (he was in fact working from home the following day).We were briefly able to meet Lucy on day 3 of our stay however she sadly seemed disinterested in speaking to us and conversation did not surpass basic 'hello's'. We were made to feel uncomfortable in the late evening when a very loud, aggressive and prolonged argument occurred outside our room which was difficult to ignore. We felt that given how much we had spent on the accommodation, this wasn't completely fair on us.Our overall impression was that this lovely apartment perhaps lacked the personal element that you might expect from your airbnb experience, leaving us feeling at times awkward and uncomfortable. We are not a couple that expect long conversations and friendships to develop from airbnb stays, however appreciate basic politeness to help us feel at ease - this was sadly lacking from an otherwise wonderful apartment.
13687	85205921	42561	6924478	Lago Poah	The key exchange process not so smooth, had to wait for the host to come home outside the door. Remember not to live your luggage with the doorman cuz apparently they were not supposed to lease the apartment on Airbnb. Which came as a surprise as there is no way for you to know. Anyway the stay was ok afterwards. But with the rate close to a hotel rate it's better to book a hotel if you want your privacy without the feeling of living under someone else's roof. The host did allow a late check out which was kind.
13687	87573801	42571	61279516	GÃ¶khan	We stayed with Lucy and Brendan for 4 days. We were welcomed by them both on the first night. We arrived late, which wasn't a problem, as it was a friday evening and we could all sleep in the day after. Their apartment is located in cool and hip neighborhood and we really enjoyed our stay. NY was really hot when we were in town. If you are a light sleeper you could be woken by the AC at night, which really is the only minus. Brendan and Lucy had prepared a nice guide for the restaurants and bars nearby, which we really liked and used a lot. Would definetely recommend!
13687	91471957	42587	81568538	Sasha	Great stay at Lucy's. They were kind and helped us with transportation. 
13687	92105961	42589	11683834	Joshua	The place was awesome! Very clean and quiet. Communicated very well with us and made our stay enjoyable. Highly recommend!
13687	94646779	42598	15249197	Sean	I stayed at Lucy's place for three days and it was  awesome! The place is clean and everything is the same as it is described. Communication with the host was also amazing. I did not have any problem checking-in and checking out. I highly recommend Lucy's place for anybody visiting NYC.
13687	95165434	42600	79524630	Philip	Our hosts were great, very friendly, helpful and informative. Really tried to help us out when our flight got cancelled at short notice. We loved the apartment with its great views from the roof and wealth of local bars and restaurants. Wish we had been staying longer. 
13687	96289759	42604	18195873	Lovelle	Both the hosts are friendly and waited patiently for us as our bus was delayed and arrived quite late at about 10pm. If you are looking for a place with elevator and clean room and bath, we will recommend the room. We appreciate the elevator because we had many luggages. The bedroom and bathroom was also very clean. However, if you are looking for a private room with private bath and washer and dryer, this is not for you. The bathroom is located outside the bedroom, which was not specified in the listing. We felt a little lack of privacy in that area. We were also not able to lock our room door. The frustrating part had to be the use of the washer and dryer. Before we arrived, we asked to use the washer and dryer on arrival but was told that we could only use the washer and dryer from 12noon to 9pm because it would make too much noise. We can understand that 10pm may be too late but to be able to only use at 12noon was a tad too late. We felt that it should be stated in the listing as one of the main reasons why we chose this place was because we wanted to be able to wash our clothes as we had a Long trip before arriving. If you are a traveling tourist and have plans in the day and have dinner before heading back, you would miss the timing for washing and drying. We did not interact much with the hosts except on arrival and on checkout. But they were friendly whenever we did. Their toy poodle was adorable! Overall, we felt that the listing could be clearer to prevent such differences in expectations. 
13687	97220961	42608	42571867	Jean-Baptiste	East village is a nice district, with plenty of restaurants and cafÃ©s ; the flat is amazing, quiet and comfortable ; Lucy (the host) is very kind and welcoming... It was a great experience!
13687	98966386	42615	38611863	Kim	We had a great time staying in East Village at Lucy and Brendan's apartment. Brendan kindly took the day off so we could check in at 3pm. The room is a good size and the private bathroom was perfect. The rooftop has impressive views of the NYC skyline. We were out most of the time so didn't have much interaction with the hosts but when we did, they were very helpful in suggesting places to eat and see. Thank you!
13687	100128031	42620	56753150	Michaela	We stayed for 4 nights, the apartment is located in a nice area with lots of bars and restaurants. East village is a good base to explore Manhatten. The subway connection is not the best, it takes at least 15 min to reach the uptown/downtown connection, but the room and the bath were nice and clean and the communication with the host was good. I would definetily recommend it. 
13687	104442494	42639	958290	Quynh-Nhu	Lucy was quick and communicative in her replies, and set me and my boyfriend up for a smooth check-in. She was away, but coordinated with her husband Brendan and arranged it so that we could do an early-check in as we were coming in from a cross-continental red-eye flight. He worked from home so he could be available to check us in, and even worked and watched television with headphones so that we could crash out immediately upon arrival. Brendan was incredibly considerate throughout our stay, and made it easy for us to come in and out on a rather extreme schedule as we were often up early and out late. The room and bathroom were clean and comfortable, and the neighborhood is great; we were walking distance to the best meal we had on that trip. Additionally, I forgot a dress, and they're kindly holding onto it until my friends can pick it up, and offered to ship it to me. Seriously, these are good people who will kindly accommodate requests if possible, and it made for a very pleasant stay. Thank you!
13687	105843642	42646	84545148	Rocy	El apartamento y la zona muy recomendables, el metro estÃ¡ relativamente cerca y se agradece estar en una zona tranquila, hay sitios de comida bastante decentes. Los anfitriones desde luego no son tan buenos, muy poco agradables, sobre todo ella, ya que el primer dÃ­a nada mÃ¡s llegar, ellos tenÃ­an un concierto, nos dijeron que podÃ­amos dejar las maletas con el portero e irnos para hacer algo de turismo antes de dormir, le dimos el nÃºmero de telÃ©fono al que nos tenÃ­a que escribir porque el mÃ­o lo tenÃ­a sin cobertura y en vez de escribir a ese nÃºmero me escribiÃ³ a mi. Cuando logramos hablar con ella, lo primero que nos dijo fue que iba a cancelar nuestra reserva porque se querÃ­an ir a dormir y hacia una hora que los habÃ­an escrito. Tuvimos que coger un taxi corriendo porque nos veÃ­amos en la calle sin  sitio donde dormir, segÃºn ella las maletas no sabÃ­a dÃ³nde estaban cuando el portero fue muy amable y las cogiÃ³ Ã©l. Cuando llegÃ³ el Ãºltimo dÃ­a, ni se molestaron en salir a despedirnos ni para preguntarnos quÃ© tal la estancia ni nada de nada. Tuvimos que dejarles las llaves encima de la cama e irnos. En resumen, muy desagradable y muy maleducada ella, el mÃ¡s o menos es mÃ¡s aceptable. Aunque al llegar nos pidiÃ³ perdÃ³n, no nos quitÃ³ el mal rato que nos hizo pasar. Recomiendo la casa y la zona, a los anfitriones NO!! 
13687	109047517	42662	24574081	Jorick	The hosts were very flexible upon or our arrival. We mostly spoke with Brandon and he was friendly and helpful. We got several suggestions for breakfast in the area. Also, he gave us the possibility to visit the Museum of Natural History (and other museum) for free.The subway is a 10 minute walk away indeed. The neighbourhood - East Village - is very youthful and lively, with lots of nice bars and restaurants (especially around Avenue A and St. Marks Place).The bedroom can be a bit noisy at night, when the window is open or the air conditioning is enabled.Overall we were are very satisfied with our stay at Lucy and Brandon's appartement. Last but no least; Trinity, the little poodle, was very amusing and friendly! :) Thanks!
13687	109605163	42665	17057985	Chih-Feng	very friendly, a clean room
13687	110392230	42668	6752444	Karen	We really liked our stay in Lucys home.. ! Very nice and clean! We would stay there again.. 
13687	111770857	42675	42615177	Andrea	The apartment is very nice and the room is spacious and comfortable. We had perfect sleeping in the large comfy queen size bed. The private bathroom is also good, recently renovated and clean. The location on C ave. is not the best in the city if you are there to visit, since the nearest metro is L line that brings to brookling (not downtown) and it's 15 mins walk away. Also not well connected to airport public transportation (2 connections at least). Lucy the host is not very friendly, she seemed to be annoyed about our presence even if we spent most of the day out. Brandon her husband was much more friendly, but the general feeling was not of a really cozy place.
13687	112548586	42680	98477084	Joy	Lucy is a great host! She is easy to communicate with and her home is lovely. My boyfriend and I were mostly out and about in NY but it was nice to come back home to warm place and a comfy bed to sleep in. 
13687	113958286	42688	74518628	Stuart	Stunning spacious apartment in magnificent location.  Great variety of local bars and restaurants.  Excellent bedroom with private bathroom.  Both Lucy and Brendan provided useful tips on what to see and do.  Maps and other helpful documents provided.  Loved East Village and would definitely stay again.
13687	115304879	42697	10296234	Cathy	The room was great, host friendly, and overall a pleasant week long stay. We were traveling for business, so having a clean and organized apartment to come back to relax and maintain privacy was perfect. Would book again in the future. 
13687	120447698	42714	1370040	Jennifer	I loved staying with Brendan and Lucy! They were kind, helpful and so above and beyond in communication. I have to go to NYC often for teaching and will definitely stay with them again!
13687	121234120	42719	36872508	Henrik	"The room is small but nice and clean and the apartment is in a good area on the edge of the East Village. Brandon, who is very friendly, met us when we arrived gave us recommendations for transport, restaurants etc. As other guests have noted the bathroom is outside the room, but that wasn't a problem for us.During our stay, there were a few incidents that made us feel a bit uncomfortable. When we arrived, we were shown around the apartment including the dining area, which is right next to the kitchen. As there is no desk or work space in the room, we used the dining table a few times to catch up on some work. We generally worked when we were alone in the apartment; however, one afternoon Lucy came back and seemed very surprised that we were using the table and mentioned that her mom was coming over for dinner later. Of course, we immediately offered to go to our room so she could use the table but the only response we got was that ""it's just a bit weird"". We were not sure what was weird about us sitting quietly working at the dining table but it felt quite passive aggressive.The morning before leaving we asked if we could use the washing machine, which is listed as an amenity, to wash our clothes before going home. Again, Lucy seemed a bit uncomfortable with this request and we were told that we couldn't use it because their clothes were in there. It wasn't because the washing machine was running, they simply had their dirty clothes in there and rather than quickly taking it out so we could use it, we were told that we couldn't use it, the result being that we had to leave with a suitcase full of dirty clothes.All in all the apartment and the location is fine but we wouldn't stay here again as we didn't feel very welcome and felt that our presence in the apartment was a nuisance."
13687	121698197	42722	34865649	Emma	The location wasn't near much that we wanted to do so we mainly took uber and later in the trip we took the bus a few times but was very easy to get back to with about a 10-20 minute uber ride. We did feel very safe coming to and from because of the key card access. The room was private and comfortable but the bathroom was in the living room which made it awkward when we heard the two hosts fighting at night so we would stay in the room mainly because we felt uncomfortable to go out there after that. Overall the stay was easy, nice and comfortable.
20681	41903585	42225	40699463	Manon	Beautiful appartement, matt is very nice just as his housemates, the subway is front of the appartement. Good times
18419	12241793	41756	457225	Helen	Kaet was a great host, friendly, quiet and clean. The apartment is a 7 minute walk to the greenpoint ave stop so it's very easy to get into Manhattan. The neighbourhood is great, laid back with families but with just enough hip restaurants and bars. Dashiell, her lil yorkie is very well behaved, I definitely fell in love with him. I would live to come back and stay again. It felt like home.
18419	13390150	41785	935608	Dele	Had a great experience staying at Kaet's place this past weekend. Her and her dog were very accommodating, the place was comfortable and she had a very warm welcome package waiting for us when we arrived. Great value for the money and would definitely recommend! 
18419	13987433	41799	6770839	Jacqueline	Kaet's place was exactly as described, and very clean. She left us a detailed description of house rules, suggestions for where to go to for restaurants, bars, etc, as well as a bottle of wine. We had a great time exploring the neighborhood around, and wouldn't hesitate to book with her again!
18419	14316950	41806	2257415	Natalie	We enjoyed our stay with Kaet. She was very welcoming and the apartment was clean and comfortable. The neighbourhood is great, close to lots of bars and restaurants, nice walking along the water.
18419	17509659	41864	16805034	Felix	During our stay Kaet was not in NYC so we shared the apartment with her Dog Dash which is an adorable little dog. Once he got to know us he wanted to cuddle with us all day!The apartment itself is very central located near the 7 train, sadly the G-train wasn't operating (station is nearby). It is a cozy place to stay with lots of space and a nice bedroom. Eventhough our host wasn't there there was a list provided which gave us information about bars/shops etc. in the neighbourhood. All in all we felt very comfortable and we would definitely recommend it! 
18419	18303235	41876	6211047	Sophie	Great area, Greenpoint. Full of nice restaurants, to discover !!Close to Manhattan by the G train, 20 min. Appartment not so big that pictures show, bathroom little small (without sink) and pets non expectated, but borough very interesting !
18419	19377302	41893	20158838	Julia	We had a really great time in NY and Kaets place was a perfect place to stay. The appartment is really cute and the room is spacious, clean and cozy! As shown in the pictures!Greenpoint is a really nice neighborhood, as is Williamsburg, just a couple of blocks away, lot of nice bars, coffee shops and restaurants.We met Kaet a couple of times, she is really friendly and always there if you need any information. She was easy to join on her cell and has always responded really quickly to our emails.So if you are looking for a warm welcome, a charming and well situated place right next to Manhattan, we strongly recommend this adresse!
18419	21616441	41932	20085304	Sheri	We would highly recommend staying with Kaet; the room is spacious, bright, and clean - and the apartment has tonnes of character and charm.  We truly enjoyed our stay here; it felt too short!Kaet is a lovely host and Dash (her dog) is so well-behaved and adorable.. The two of them were highlights of the trip for us.  We loved the neighborhood, and found it very quick and easy to get to Manhattan on the subway... but really Brooklyn is awesome and you could spend most of your time in Kaet's neighborhood anyway!  The coffee shop across the street from the apartment is awesome as well; delicious food and friendly people!  Would come back in a heartbeat!
18419	22199262	41944	2782444	Steven	We had a great stay at Kaet's apartment. The neighborhood is awesome, and the apartment is located within walking distance of both the G and 7 trains. Kaet was also incredibly easy to communicate with. Most people probably don't drive to NYC, but if you do it's worth noting that her street has pretty reliable (and free) parking. Her dog, Dash, was a lot of fun as well!
18419	26819766	42055	24462448	Felicia	This was my first time with Airbnb and Kaet made the entire experience exquisite! From the quick and easy communication before moving in, till the day I left, everything was what I had expected and more. The place definitely has character and is exactly what the pictures represent. It has a warm/homey feel to it. The bedroom is big and spacious, and the bed was especially comfy.There were no unexpected surprises. Kaet allocated enough space for me put all my stuff for the entire 5 weeks, so the space would be more than enough for shorter stays. Because the room is at the front, you can hear when other tenants are coming in and out, but that wasn't a big deal to me.The neighbourhood is great! There are a lot of coffee joints and bars close by and it's close to laundromats and grocery shops. When I would get home late, the area still felt really safe, which is important if you're going to be out exploring the city till dark. Its also about a 5-8 minute walk to the subway station (G train). It would take about 30mins to get to Manhattan in peak morning times.Kaet is a great fun-loving and easygoing person and I think it would be hard for anyone to not love her and her dog. I definitely recommend staying here, whether your quiet and reserved or more outgoing! Thanks for a great month Kaet! :)
18419	31711976	42133	29147349	Jolien	Kaet made us feel very welcome! The appartment is really lovely and clean and is just like in the pictures. Kaet had a quik responce to our questions so thats really nice.The dog dash is really sweet once he gets to know you , then he wants to kuddle you all day.To get to manhatten it takes about 30 minutes. I would definitely recommend this place to other people. 
18419	32807373	42146	2234623	Albert	Our stay at Kaet's place was lovely! She's very kind and helpful and her  dog Dash must be the most adorable dog I've ever met. Her place is very nice with a good kitchen and even a small garden. We stayed for about a week and explored NYC and Brooklyn. There are several great restaurants just a short walk away but you can also take the ferry downtown just a couple of blocks away.  
18419	36260522	42182	24482282	Cheryl	Thank you for having us in your home Kaet! We enjoyed our 1 month stay in Brooklyn. The area has a diverse mix of stores where you can get your daily necessities without travelling out too far. The main street offers an array of cafes, restaurants, laundromats, phone shops and convenience stores where you can get daily necessities at cheap prices. The main area of shops is about a 15 to 20 minute walk from the apartment. It is approximately an 8 minute walk to the nearest train station. The station is convenient when travelling to Manhattan and Brooklyn.The room size and facilities are as what you see in the photos, except a little dimmer. There happened to be construction directly opposite the apartment and it got pretty noisy especially on the weekdays when we were home. But it does end around early evening time. Every now and then, we do get to hear conversations of passer-bys as the room window faces the street.Kaet provided sufficient storage space in the room and the fridge. She also has a fully-equipped kitchen with cutlery and appliances if you ever plan to cook. All the utilities (i.e. hot water shower, toilet, stove, wireless internet, electric sockets, fridge, and air-conditioning) were in good working condition throughout our entire stay.Kaet is a generous and easy-going host who respects your personal space. She is willing to share her knowledge about Brooklyn and New York with you. And not forgetting Dashell, who is the sweetest dog that loves to cuddle and will greet you (over-excitedly) when you're at the door.We had a great stay at Kaet's home and would recommend it to anyone who wishes to stay in Brooklyn.
18419	46860053	42261	27254094	Cecilia	It was my first Airbnb experience and Kaet was an awesome hostess! She was very quick to respond and was always so helpful. Her home has everything you need. I want to make a list of all the things I thought made my stay at Kaet's awesome:- Kaet was so understanding about my very late check in. (Thank you!)- The BED!! Amazing bed!! You fall asleep the moment you lay down and wake up super energized!- Dashell (her dog) is the cutest most friendly dog ever!- Towels are awesome!!- Lots of space for storage!- Netflix! Went through a whole season of one show during my stay.- The neighborhood is just perfect for a trip to NY. Close to the subway, buses, and even the ferry! - 10 seconds away from the nearest coffee shop (really good coffee AND sandwiches)I could go on and on but to sum it up, I would definitely recommend Kaet's home to anyone who is going to NY and I would love to stay here again! :)
18419	51275775	42296	34384564	Darnielle	We were made very welcome by Kaet with a bottle of wine on arrival and entrance instructions, keys, dog etc exactly as described.  The apartment is compact but exactly as described and we enjoyed our stay very much.  The neighbourhood had everything we needed and one of the days we didn't even go in to the city!
18419	56162028	42347	7891403	Kila	Kaet was super welcoming (chalkboard welcome sign and a bottle of wine on arrival!), friendly and helpful. The room is big and as described. Her dog Dash is a dude! 
18419	62503043	42415	2714474	Michaela	Kaet's apartment was incredible! I stayed here a month and it was exactly what I was looking for. It was clean, bright, cosy and you felt at home the minute you walked through the door! Kaet welcomed me with a bottle of wine, and even left her Netflix on. She was very accommodating and always responded to emails straight away! The location is also perfect, so many quaint cafes, boutiques, brunch spots, and a two second walk away from Brookyln Ice Cream Factory! I highly recommend Kaet's place, and would love to stay here again!
18419	66517731	42452	60144677	Tina	Kaet is a lovely host. The appartment is very well located and Dash the dog is super cute!
18419	67820143	42460	11610043	Barbora	We loved our stay in this apartment, Kaet (and the little adorable Dash) was super friendly, understandable and helpful and made us feel very welcome. The apartment feels lovely and has an amazingly comfortable bed. :) The place and area are great, it is located in nice neighborhood with lots of restaurants, bars and shops, the metro stop is only a short walk away and the connection to Manhattan is fast and easy. There is not one negative thing we can say about our stay here and if we could, we would book at Kaet again. Donâ??t forget to stop by at the coffee shop just opposite the apartment to grab a coffee and sandwich!
18419	69297115	42470	10929245	Anna	Kaet was a wonderful host! She was always quick to respond to our questions and made us feel incredibly welcome in her home. Her dog, Dash, is so precious and Kaet even gave us a bottle of wine upon arrival. I would definitely stay here again!
18419	70920118	42482	64233136	Sandy	Kaet made us feel very welcome.  The room was very quaint, clean, and comfortable.  She was a very gracious host and was very helpful in giving us information about getting around the city.  If I'm ever in Brooklyn again I would definitely stay there again!
18419	74892541	42507	8045596	Robyn	Kaet made us very welcome on arrival she is a very friendly lady. We enjoyed staying in Greenpoint area, there are good eating places,  supermarkets and transportation to wherever you want to go. 
18419	75936748	42513	61460429	Veronica	Helpful host who made us feel welcome.
18419	92600069	42591	8641516	Herwolt	Voelden ons direct meer dan welkom.Buurt was absoluut prettig met fijne horeca op de hoek en huurfietsen binnen bereik. Leuke nostalgische jaren '50 huisstijl!
18419	96783034	42606	87927379	Gunhild	I did not meet Kaet in person, as she was out of town while I stayed there, but still she made me feel very welcome. She responded quickly to all my messages and left a bottle of wine and personalized welcome notes for me. She had also put together a very useful info sheet about the place and area, shops and restaurants for instance. The apartment has nice vintage interior with some very cool details, and has a nice backyard. The bed is very good. I would stay there again if I could.
18419	100978352	42624	77693614	Daniela	Vierailumme Kaetin luona oli ihana! Huone oli suuri ja kotoisa. Asunnossa oli mukava tunnelma ja kaikkialla oli todella siistiÃ¤. Kaet oli upea emÃ¤ntÃ¤, varmisti aina, ettÃ¤ meillÃ¤ oli kaikkea mitÃ¤ tarvitsimme ja sai olomme erittÃ¤in tervetulleiksi. Greenpoint on todella kivaa aluetta, suosittelen ehdottomasti, jos asuminen Brooklynissa houkuttelee. Tulisimme tÃ¤nne mielellÃ¤Ã¤n uudelleenkin! 
18419	104539960	42640	58812819	Ludovic	Kaet is a very welcome host ! The room is very clean and towels are available. Situation of appartement is perfect, in a nice neighborhood of Brooklyn. 5 minutes by feet to subway, just not far away, and 5 minutes to a stop of the East River Ferry. So easy to go to downtown ! You can book there with eyes closed ! ;)

18419	112370379	42679	30818174	Eleonora	Kaet is perfect! host responsive, friendly, ready to answer any questions and make the company at dinner)) her pet dog Dash is a miracle. the apartment is very comfortable, room practically suite! this is a great area, clean, quiet all you need for life near, close to the underground train of L and G, is very convenient.

11191	59128472	42376	37678628	Kenneth	this apartment is super cool and is really good. host is really nice and always answer back .
25348	68532971	42465	59196226	James	We had a very good stay in the apartment, which is cozy and wonderfully located in the active and hip Lower East Side neighbourhood. Would definitely stay there again on future NYC visits.! Note: the piano is no longer there, which shouldn't matter to non-players. Frees up more space, actually. The shower is tricky to operate, if you haven't seen the mechanism before. It requires pulling down on the end of the bathtub faucet to get the water to come out the shower faucet. Once you've done it once, it's easy.Take advantage of this gem when coming to New York. Well worth it!James from Toronto
25348	69869960	42474	46335103	Suzanne	Our stay with Shasta was wonderful!  We stayed with Shasta for a week.  His apartment is just like the photos. It is simply a GREAT place. The feeling in the apartment is very cozy and comfortable.  The bed was VERY comfortable.  Everything was clean, neat, organized and very inviting. It was very bright and sunny during the day.  I was extremely comfortable there.  The location was also fabulous.  MANY wonderful restaurants, within walking distance, including famous Katz Deli.   Very easy access to the subway and very easy for Uber to find.  We had a fantastic time and simply LOVED Shasta's place.  I would definitely stay with Shasta again, and I would recommend him as a host to anyone.  
25348	71481180	42485	37776187	Jen	The listing looks as pictured (minus the piano). It's small, but that's NYC for you and you won't spend much time in it anyway. The location is by FAR the bast thing about this place. It's perfectly situated for someone that wants to be in the heart of a thriving city. And yes, that means there is a lot of street noise at night - it's just that kind of neighbourhood.  Shasta was very responsive via text and getting in and out of the place was a breeze. 
25348	73593925	42498	7162869	Sandra	We stayed one night in Shasta's lovely urban apartment. It was super cozy on a very idyllic East Village street. Loved sitting on the fire stairs right outside the window gazing over the last sun rays in between the houses, listening to the sounds of the city and people meeting up for a Saturday beer.  Would defiantly recommend anyone to stay there!   
25348	75203273	42509	7868464	Î?Î±Ï?Î¯Î¶	The apartment was nice, cozy and in a nice neibourghood. Very clean.Few notice for improvment: on arrival we got the keys in a box in a proximate place. There were not enough instructions about the apartment settings (eg were is the button to open light when you get in or how the shower works, how to open the windows etc.. (for us Europeans, it is not known, for Americans maybe evident). We had to inform Shasta that there was only one fourk (he corrected). Our feeling is that if nobody shows the place, it should have detailed printed instructions in the apartment and more details when coming for convenience, such as the ring (very basic when 2 persons have only one set of keys). Again our european ignorance has to do. Maybe it would be useful to have a small table to eat with confort. Otherwise we loved our stay.
25348	77871879	42525	5590859	Richard	Shasta is a great host, very responsive, and made picking up the keys very easy.  Also, the apartment is wonderful - spacious and quiet, and in a great location.  I would happily stay here again.
25348	78077201	42526	706654	Huong	Shasta was very understanding and accommodating when we contacted him at the last minute in regards to having a sick child right before the trip. We would recommend his home to anyone.  We look forward to staying at his place in the near future.
25348	79862366	42535	8356534	Christina	The apartment location is about 10 min walk from subway station Essex St or Delancey St. It's on the 2F, so not too many steps to climb. It's a very good size of alone traveller or a couple. The bedroom was full of light thanks to the two big windows, the living room could be a little dark in comparison, but most of the time I was out during the day, so I didn't mind. Shasta was very thorough with directions and prompt to respond to my questions. 
25348	80398865	42539	2762694	Matt	The place is in a great location. Right in the heart of LES. Easy walk to Ivan Ramen, Clinton Street Baking Co, Chari and Co, Only NY,  and many other great spots. The space was a decent size for a NY apartment. The entertainment system was nice too. We had to get one night of GOT in and the speakers / TV setup was nice. Only gripes are that the bedsheets were pretty dirty and the shower head kept falling down. 
25348	81464481	42544	4698240	Laura	"The Appartment was great, very bright and friendly. It is a place where you like to spend a few hours ""at home"". We enjoyed the neighbourhood with many good opportunities to eat just around the corner. We didn't meet shasta, but everything went well with the descriptions we got.I would choose this appartment again."
25348	83052039	42552	28167416	Colin	Shasta's place has the potential to be amazing; phenomenal location and set up with the big bed and sleeper couch. However, when I arrived I needed to immediately fix the pull down blinds, fasten a shower head holster from my belt, and there was some left over drinking bottles/personal items scattered amidst the apartment. 
25348	84620555	42559	64859380	Russell	This is a great place in a great spot. There were two of us staying here and it was more that comfortable. Short train ride to everywhere. Restaurants; nightlife; good coffee just around the corner (that's saying something in the US : ). The place is just as described - safe, comfortable. clean and quiet. Just what you need after a long walks through NYC. Picking up the keys was super easy; the host checked in on how we were going and got back to me quickly when I had a question. Also there is a great sound system. 
25348	91582760	42588	13016455	Anne	Le logement est trÃ¨s correct, bien agencÃ©. Il y a possibilitÃ© de repasser des vÃªtements. Des boissons Ã©taient dans le frigidaire et les produits de premiÃ¨re nÃ©cessitÃ© (cuisine ou bains) Ã©taient Ã  disposition. Guide livre Ã©galement Ã  disposition avec parapluie si besoin. La climatisation est rÃ©ellement la bienvenue mÃªme si bruyante.
25348	97722988	42610	43858857	David	Great location and really close to the subway. Very close to a great brunch place which was recommended to us by Shasta. Would recommend to stay here and if going back would look to stay there again.
25348	98437911	42613	14864180	Sharath	Cozy-Hip place, great location 
25348	100296144	42621	411916	Brandon	Like other reviewers have said, nice little studio apartment in a great location, tons of bars/restaurants within walking distance. Check-in via KeyCafe was seamless, and the instructions Shasta sent were very thorough, albeit last-minute. Generally clean, except for a few items of trash that were left out. Heard mice scurrying around at night, and saw a few cockroaches. Noisy on the street at night, too. Not a big deal, but putting it out there in the interest of full disclosure.
25348	102264370	42630	16903265	Joseph	The host was great at responding to all inquiries and concerns. The unit was clean and the location is in a fun neighborhood. The sound system, as others have noted, is great. The place is also very nicely furnished.
25348	103015955	42633	58067942	Rebecca	This was my first AirBnB experience and everything went better than I expected! Loved the neighborhood and the apartment is on a quiet, quaint street. Highly recommend!
25348	104142972	42638	26186754	Kate	Great apartment, in a great location in LES. Close to transport, fantastic restaurants and bars nearby. Apartment itself was a little small, but very comfortable and has everything you need. It can get quite noisy at night,  both from the street and movements in other adjoining apartments. A good size for a couple. Shasta's instructions were great and made some good nearby suggestions. Thanks for a great stay!
25348	105846230	42646	38440924	Morgane	L'appartement est idÃ©alement situÃ©, tous les lieux touristiques sont directs depuis les lignes de mÃ©tro F,M,J et Z (Ã  5min Ã  pied de l'appartement).Nous avons eu un petit problÃ¨me pour recuperer les clÃ©s mais l'hÃ´te a Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s rÃ©actif :) L'environnement est un peu bruyant le soir mais rien qui n'empÃªche le sommeil.Je recommande dÃ©finitivement cet appartement 
25348	108730266	42660	4152806	Sophie	This was a great little New York apartment. The location is great, the bed was super comfortable and tourists that we are, we loved the typical New York fire escape outside.Shasta replied quickly to any query we had and overall I loved staying there!
25348	109663801	42665	6251292	Elaine	Stanton Street in the Lower East Side is an extremely lively area. Great for little restaurants and skateboarding shops. An excellent skate park designed by Nike under the Manhattan Bridge is just ten minutes cycle ( Frankie's Bike Hire nearby ). Chinatown and Little Italy 10 mins on foot. the flat is small and the second bed only a rigid sofa sleeping one person.
25348	111542978	42674	42736975	Brandon	Check-in was fairly convenient easy although it was pushed back a little bit because of poor timing. The place is a great location yet very conducive to rest. Instructions were clear and communication was great. Wi-Fi could have been better. 
25348	112593111	42680	1206579	Angelina	The apartment itself is very cosy and ideally suits two people. It has everything you need. Lots of small cafes and bars around. Close to Union Square and Soho. The only thing is a bit too noisy outside in the early morning. We were getting used to it a couple of days.
25348	114456595	42692	3173599	Vanja	Everything was exactly as Sasha said it would be. Clean and cosy place. Wonderful neighborhood. I had a blast!
25348	114886808	42694	5411546	Margaret	Shasta's place was great! The neighborhood was fun and not too loud at night, easy walk to good restaurants & bars. The place was clean and had everything we needed. 
25348	115413451	42698	52164144	Desiree	awesome stay! loved the location. easy communication. thank you. 
25348	117329168	42710	35982331	Matthew	Absolutely fantastic location and a lovely space. Would stay here again for sure. Thanks very much
25348	120074845	42711	24223937	Declan	Shasta was great for communications - unfortunately I did not get to meet him as it was during a working day. The place itself was really cosy - clean and homely. I love this part of the city - its really close to some great bars and restaurants and is a very cool part of the city. I would thoroughly recommend this spot :)
25348	121807702	42723	2357037	Mercia	Had a great stay at Shasta's apartment in mid December.  Location is perfect for those looking to get the feeling of what it would be like to live in a New York City apartment.  There's activity in the neighborhood at night with people out and about, but the apartment was nice and quite.  Quick walk to the subway, corner market and plenty of bars and restaurants nearby.  Communication with Shasta was a breeze and was impressed with the organized and detailed instructions he gave once check-in arrived.  Would absolutely stay there again.   
25348	122895699	42730	3953996	Natalie	The place was cozy and clean, in a great location! The area is full of great bars and restaurants, as well as shops and markets if you don't want to go out. Shasta provided all of the necessary information to make arrival and departure smooth, and the apartment was a great little home base for our holidays in New York.
25348	130331206	42771	23198259	Rhi	Awesome place right in the middle of the LES and short walk to the subway. Communication was easy and the place was clean and had everything we needed
25348	135145047	42797	103463616	Lisa	Shasta's place is beautifully well-lit and in a easily accessible, safe location.  The apartment is clean, with all the basics so you can enjoy your time in the city without hassle!  Plenty of awesome spots in the area to enjoy.  I highly recommend this location to anyone and hope to be able to stay again some day.
25348	135590131	42799	33328253	Melanie	Excellent location in the middle of East village with lots of bars, restaurants and coffee shops. Place was clean and tidy. Heat was working (which was great as it was freezing over the weekend) but the radiators make a lot of noise that was loud enough to wake us up!
25348	136242309	42803	4249538	Joe	Handy, comfy spot. Would definitely stay again. Great communication and very helpful.
25348	137286377	42808	61211050	Ahmed	Excellent place , exactly as described , very helpful host , will sure consider in my next  visits 
33759	71187323	42484	25594212	Rebecca	The apartment was exactly as described and depicted - if anything, it's bigger than it looks in photos and was immaculate!  The bedroom was back off the street so was really quiet (for NYC).  This is a great place to stay especially if you want to get a sense for what it's like to live in Manhattan with the subway a short walk, great eats in every direction, and Central Park just a block away.  The host reached out to me ahead of time to make sure we had all the information we needed and was very friendly.  I would highly recommend this location and host!!  
37505	3659493	41334	4589753	Kevin	Had an awesome stay with Susan and Marco, the apartment is amazing! Super clean, awesome bed and in an amazing part of Brooklyn. Super close to the JMZ and only 10 min to the L train. Susan and Marco are always available to give advice and are very sweet. 
37505	4325134	41392	5155811	Cristina	At Marco and Susanâ??s home we were able to taste the real Williamburg life and not just as tourists.  Their helpfulness and willingness to provide information were integral in enabling us to get the most out of our trip.  The apartment is cosy, very light and near to all services, including bike rent.   We recommend it in particular to tall people, because here you will find a bed big enough for your long legs.  One day we will be back for another roof barbecue!
37505	4422016	41398	5971764	Jeroen	We spent a great week in NYC. We used the apartment as starting point of our walking routes through Williamsburg and Manhattan. This apartment is located just near the Williamsburg Bridge. And as said in the description very near to the subway stations.The apartment itself is spacious and clean. And very light because of the windows which gave a great view on the Washington Plaza Park.We had a spacious bedroom and access to a private bathroom. The way from the bedroom to the bathroom is separated by curtains from the rest of the living room. We could use the kitchen, but there were too many nice restaurants nearby, to really make usage of...!Susan and Marco are great hosts. They gave us a warm welcome and good advice what to do in NYC, where to go to, and where to eat.
37505	4457631	41400	338961	Edward	Susan and Marco were wonderful hosts.  My wife and I, inspired by Anthony Bourdain to visit Brooklyn, had a wonderful weekend.  This loft is located just 2 blocks from the Marcy Ave. subway stop, right on the south side of Williamsburg.  There are tons of restaurants, bars and shops within minutes walk.  Also, we used the bus several times for access to and from Crown Heights, Prospect Heights and Downtown Brooklyn.  The apartment was clean and comfortable.  The king sized bed induced coma like sleep all night.  We would highly recommend this place for your next Brooklyn adventure.
37505	4710735	41415	5640047	Pierre	This was our first airbnb experience and it could not have been better. Susan and Marco are really great hosts. Susan made herself available although she and Marco were very busy organizing the Brooklyn Film Festival. The appartment itself is very well located in the heart of Williamsburg. There is everything you need in a short walking distance: grocery store, restaurants, shops, transportation. Manhattan is very close using the subway lines J M and Z. The appartment and the room were clean and comfy. The private bathroom was really a plus. We really enjoyed our 10 days stay and definitely recomend this place to anyone who wants to live a true New York experience.    
37505	4763716	41418	6175909	Roxie	This was our first Air BnB experience and it couldn't have been better! Susan and Marco were absolutely fantastic hosts - incredibly accommodating, friendly and great to chat to. The bedroom and bathroom were immaculately clean, the wifi was fast, the TV was massive and the bed was comfy. What's more, the location was perfect for walking around Williamsburg and hopping on the subway over to Manhattan. We would more than happily stay with Susan again! 
37505	4916994	41427	5208701	Cecilie	We truly enjoyed our stay with Susan and Marco. The location was perfect, and the room was spacious with private bathroom. Great value for money, and Susan made us feel very welcome with a relaxed atmosphere. 
37505	5219107	41443	6779661	Lillian	Our hosts Susan and Marco were very nice...welcoming and helpful! Though our stay was brief and we saw little of each other beyond our meeting during 'check-in,' we felt well-provided-for, and our accommodations were great!

37505	5420021	41454	4654993	Ruth	Lovely apartment in a great location, close to subway stops, and all amenities. Susan and Macro were friendly, accommodating and made me feel at home. Lovely room and bath room, overall a great stay! 
37505	5568380	41461	7086063	Kaldora	Susan and Marco's apartment has everything you would need or want in a rented room.. Lovely spacious room, beautiful clean private bathroom, wifi, location close to subway and last but no means least friendly accommodating host.  A definite recommendation..
37505	6076636	41484	6202765	Capucine	The loft was great, our room really comfy, the private bathroom nice and clean. The place is perfectly located in Brooklyn. Susan and Marco were really kind to us and we recommend you to stay there !
37505	7363427	41534	6018429	Lisa	Susan and Marco are bloody fantastic (and so is their lovely apartment)!We recently spent 11 nights in their perfectly located, spacious apartment and felt entirely welcome. Make no mistake, you will be staying in the best place from which to explore New York. Although we found it very difficult to leave Williamsburg (so much going on there) Manhattan was just one stop away from either of the two subway stations that were a few minutes walk from the apartment. We had a very private space cordoned off for us including our own bathroom and sitting room. The bedroom was lovely with a supremely comfortable bed and a big screen TV with full cable.We would unreservedly recommend staying with Susan and Marco and want to thank them again for making us feel so welcome. 
37505	7508173	41540	4928752	Lies	Great apartment!Spacious room, very comfy bed!Nice and clean bath room!Great location, 3 min. walk from subway, 2 min. walk from Williamsburg Bridge and Bedford Avenue.Trendy, lively neighborhood but the room was quiet. Lots of good restaurants and shops.Nice hosts...give you a lot of privacy.
37505	7591946	41542	138245	Jennifer	Susan was great! Very communicative, charming. The apartment is fantastic and in (IMHO) one of the best neighborhoods in Brooklyn. 
37505	7697892	41547	5966394	Gary	Lovely apartment, great location, comfortable bed.  Works for me!
37505	7879698	41554	2338508	Natalie	The flat was clean, funky, very 'brooklyn' and in a great location - 5 mins from Marcy Ave and 10 mins from Bedford stations. Having our own bathroom was a plus. Susan and Marco were polite and discrete hosts - flexible with our check-in and check-out times. Highly recommended and would stay here again. A+
37505	8017812	41560	7220433	Michela	Susan is very nice and friendly, the apartment is great, perfectly located, in an amazing neighbourhood. I strongly recommend this accommodation!
37505	8279707	41570	8868306	Brenda	Great place to stay! 
37505	8441974	41578	7270200	Sandra	Susan was an amazing host, super warm and friendly. The room was great, the bed was pretty comfortable, and the washroom impeccable. But the best of all was the location, it was a 5 minutes walk to Bedford street with lots of beautiful restaurants, coffee shops, and stores. And also right besides the Williamsburg bridge connecting to Manhattan and the metro. The only one tinny drawback was that we could hear the metro at night passing by, but that didn't really bother my husband or I.
37505	8817385	41597	9017908	Francisca	Susan and Marco were great hosts, so kind to share cool tips about Manhattan and Williamsburg in particular. Their home is as amazing and easy going as the photos suggest, and the bedroom with private bath is likely better than most hotels. All in all really happy we chose their place and would recommend it to anyone willing to go visit NYC and also have a nice Brooklyn experience. 
37505	9090012	41614	9240172	Natalie	Susan's place is a wonderfully decorated loft in the heart of Williamsburg. The bridge is right next to the apartment building giving perfect access to Manhattan on foot. There are also two subway stations about 5 minute walk away from the flat. So the location is pretty much perfect. Williamsburg is a super trendy neighbourhood with so much going on. We spent the majority of our evenings in the local bars and restaurants rather than going into manhattan. The bedroom is an ideal retreat for a god night sleep after a day exploring NYC. We both agreed that the bed was THE BEST we had ever slept in. The mattress is a memory foam mattress which is heavenly to sleep in.The property is very clean and the hosts are very welcoming and fab to talk to. The private bathroom is a real plus and you feel like half the flat is yours as they pull a curtain through the middle.We would highly recommend this flat to friends and hope to be back again.
37505	9219341	41622	3807375	Lisa	I really enjoyed staying with Susan and her husband at their spacious loft. The apartment also doubles as an office as they organize the Brooklyn Film Festival.I would have liked to have talked to them more about movies and the festival, but they were busy and I was out a lot of the time as well.  Still, Susan was very friendly and helpful in suggesting how to get around town.The location is a great if you want to explore Williamsburg and go out for food and drinks. It's quite close to Bedford Avenue, which is sort of the main street with many bars, restaurants and shops. It's also about a 10-minute walk from a train station, so it's easy to get into the city. I spent an afternoon seeing the sights in midtown Manhattan and got back early enough to meet for drinks and dinner with a friend in Williamsburg.Although it's close to a subway station, I would still suggest taking a taxi from the airport. It's about $50 - $60 from JFK, if you go by car service.The room is lovely with a lot of character, as well as a comfortable bed and big-screen TV. It was also great to have a bathroom to myself.Be aware though, if you plan to make food in their kitchen, they don't have a microwave and they have a gas stove. But there are so many cheap-ish places to eat nearby that you shouldn't have or want to eat in too much.I would definitely try to stay here again when I'm back in Williamsburg. 
37505	10043826	41666	3468712	Tom	Wouldn't hesitate for a second to recommend this place - beautiful apartment, fantastic location, perfect balance of privacy and hospitality, and two very charming and interesting hosts!The room is really nicely fitted out, and a great size, the bed is amazingly comfy, the TV is enormous, and the lovely private bathroom is obviously a major plus. Can't imagine getting a hotel room this comfy, attractive and convenient for anywhere near as good value. Too much great/fun stuff nearby to mention, but in the immediate vicinity Pies and Thighs and the Bagel Store were particular highlights. The apartment is also right next to the pedestrian ramp on to the Williamsburg Bridge, which is a pretty spectacular/dramatic way to get across to Manhattan (even in a snowstorm, as it was when I crossed it!)Highly recommended all round, thanks again Susan and Marco!
37505	10403241	41687	11975955	Gavin	Lovely room and welcoming hosts. Had a great stay and would defiantly come back.Thanks again Susan. 
37505	10515561	41693	11544761	Jake	This was the perfect space in the perfect part of town for our trip. Located at the base of the Williamsburg bridge and two blocks from the Marcy subway station we were able to get just about anywhere we wanted quickly and on the cheap. The apartment is clean and quiet and the the private bathroom makes it feel like your own. Susan and her husband Marco are friendly and laid back. They have lived in the neighborhood a long time and can point you toward the best things to do, see, and eat. I will certainly be staying here again on my next trip to New York and will be recommending it to other travelers as well.
37505	10936730	41712	4997112	Michael	Zu Zweit verbrachten wir 6 NÃ¤chte bei Susan und ihrem Ehemann. Das Schlafzimmer und das Badezimmer haben eine angenehme grÃ¶sse. Der Duvetbezug bleibt uns in kuscheliger Erinnerung- in Ã?gyptischer Seide schlÃ¤ft es sich tiptop. Tageslicht gibt es im Zimmer leider nicht, dafÃ¼r hat es einen grossen Flachbildschirm mit pay-TV. An PrivatsphÃ¤re hat es nicht gemangelt. 
37505	11276973	41726	10554667	Carlos	Beautiful loft in a fantastic location, with lots of places to eat and drink nearby. Susan was a great host and helped us with useful tips to have a wonderful time in NYC. I definitely recommend it!
37505	11473963	41733	13340494	Martine	Nice loft in Williamsburg with independant bathroom, well situated.We slept well.Susan was a lovely hostess.We'll certainly come again for another stay.Martine. 
37505	13091381	41778	5895665	Djamal	Accueil trÃ¨s chaleureux, discrÃ¨te tout en Ã©tant disponible. Susan est une trÃ¨s bonne hÃ´te. Logement trÃ¨s bien Ã©quipÃ©, confortable, bon rapport qualitÃ© prix. Merci Susan.D
37505	13426188	41786	7117182	Gary	Susan was an excellent host.  The room was as described, is in a great location, and close to subway.  I would recommend this location.  
37505	13752209	41793	7515578	Jon	Beautiful apartment, and a brilliant location - five minutes from Marcy St subway station. We particularly enjoyed cycling over the Williamsburg bridge - there's a citibike station directly outside the apartment. You register with a credit card, pay a fee, then any 30 min cycle is free. We found it took 20 mins to get across the bridge into Manhattan at a leisurely pace...and what a view! The bed is great, very cool decor in the bedroom, private bathroom. Everything was clean. Susana and Marco were very busy as the film festival they organise began on the day we arrived, so we didn't see/speak to them much, but they showed us around, provided tea and invited us to the launch party on the first day and we met a lot of interesting and charming filmmakers. 
37505	14681934	41814	13433265	Andrea	I was at Susan house last week.It is a fantastic house, the room is big, the bed very confy and the private bathroom clean. Williamsburg is great and the house very well located.Susan and Marco were very hospitable!I will suggest this house to all my friends planning a trip to NYC.
37505	15193459	41824	12098069	Elliot	Susan provides a quiet, comfortable, and clean room in her beautiful flat. The neighborhood is vibrant, with lots of nearby amenities. Recommended for those who want a place to sleep in Williamsburg for a couple of nights--this is not a private hotel room, as it is part of her private residence, but she does a great job providing a comfortable spot to relax.
37505	15416207	41828	15903810	Sylvie	Nous venons de passer un trÃ¨s agrÃ©able sÃ©jour chez Susan et Marco. La chambre est spacieuse et sa dÃ©co trÃ¨s sympa. Le lit est trÃ¨s trÃ¨s confortable. Il n'y a pas de clim mais le ventilateur rend la chaleur tout Ã  fait acceptable. Le quartier est animÃ© mais pas bruyant. Station de mÃ©tro proche. Pensez aussi Ã  prendre le ferry (6$) pour vous rendre Ã  Manhattan c'est magnifique!!
37505	15683923	41834	14991772	Matt & Caity	What a great place. Two blocks from the metro with a quick trip to downtown Manhattan, incredibly accommodating hosts and a clean, spacious room with your own bathroom. We wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place to anybody looking to stay and explore Brooklyn and the surrounding area. Book soon before it fills up. 
37505	16777460	41853	15903810	Sylvie	I spent about 3 weeks in this apartment. Susan and Marco are very welcoming, they are always here for help you. Their apartment is beautiful and spacious. The new terrace is very pretty, you can eat or just have a rest. I spent a wonderful time ! Charlotte
37505	18988949	41886	16453346	Daniel	I spent two nights at Susan's place in Williamsburg and was very happy with my choice of accommodation. The apartment is nice and clean, Susan a very welcoming and nice host, and the neighbourhood very interesting with hipsters and orthodox jews side by side. It was the hottest day of the summer, so I was particularly glad that there was a fan in my room.Daniel
37505	19188783	41890	4946584	Mark	Was very welcoming. Allowed us to store our bags earlier than the check in time.Susan gave great advice about places to eat and where to visit while in NYC.The nice perk was being so close to the Ferry - $4.00 to get into the city vs the $35.00 by taxi.We spent very little time in the room. We stayed very active (and sought out places with air condition in the warmest days of the summer of 2014)
37505	19412344	41894	18263441	David	This place is a real gem. I had a great stay-- the owners made me feel 100% welcome and at home. The loft is gorgeous--exposed brick, hardwoods, scenic patio, private full bath--with plenty of space. Very comfortable bed. Neighborhood is great, and there is quick access to the trains at Marcy, just a few blocks away. HIGHLY recommended!
37505	19905043	41902	7939623	Elizabeth	This is a fantastic location for staying in Williamsburg. The room is super quiet, and the bed is very comfortable. The apartment is exactly as described in the listing, clean and welcoming. I highly recommend staying here.
37505	20598507	41914	15973406	Maria	We stayed at Susan and Marco's place one week in late september 2014.It was our first trip to New York, and looked for good location at a reasonable price. Their place offered just what we were looking for, and only one stop away from Manhattan!The private room includes a comfortable bed, which can be highly recommeded to persons with back/muscle problems.Having your own bathroom just next to the bedroom is great, and when the big black curtains are drawn, you get full privacy.Susan and Marco let you use their kitchen and outside patio, and they're very kind, discrete and nice to talk to. Give you great advice about shops and restaurants in Williamsburg and Brooklyn, and how to get around the city.Williamsburg is hip, young and vibrant. Walk down Bedford Av. and Driggs and feel the vibes - great shops, cafÃ©es, bakeries all over the place.We highly reccomend Susan and Marco as hosts.
37505	20818886	41918	3520709	Elaine	Susan and Marco's home was perfect for our stay in NYC. I was there for a conference (one day) and to tour around my boyfriend a few days following. Their home is delightful, artistic, comfortable, homey and very welcoming. As stated in other review, the bed is absolutely one of the most comfortable I've slept in (via AirBnB) and because of my discomfort with bedbugs in general, knowing that it was one of the kinds that will NOT harbor bedbugs made me even more comfortable. I was very thankful as I've had bad experiences in NY in the past, so hooray! This is a GREAT option if you're also concerned.Things I always look for - hot water, a nice shower, and a comfortable bed. All around, these things were stellar in Susan and Macro's home.The neighborhood was also great, a quick taxi to Prospect Park and Bed-Stuy, a quick train ride into Manhattan, and many lovely restaurants, bars and shops along the way. I could not have asked for a more convenient and easy location to get to all the places I know and love. 
37505	21698739	41934	16738534	Alex	Susan and her husband were very welcoming and friendly. Their apartment was lovely and modern and our room was spacious and had the greatest bed of all time in it. Williamsburg is a great area to stay. It has shops, restaurants and bars, all within waking distance if the apartment and it's so easy to pop across into Manhattan. Highly recommended. 
37505	21947620	41939	1575781	Victor	We had a great time in NYC and staying at the loft was the perfect location to get to all of the places we wanted to see in Manhattan.  The space is clean and comfortable (the bed is great!) and it had everything we needed for our stay.  Highly recommended!
37505	22518027	41952	12560245	Chris	Susan and her Husband were fantastic hosts who made us feel right at home from the minute we arrived. The apartment itself is fantastic; spacious, comfortable and exactly as listed. You will enjoy your own room and bathroom, both were perfect for my wife and I.The apartments location is fantastic, only a 5 min walk to the J train, and not much longer to the L train. 1 min from Bedford Ave and all the restaurants, bars and boutiques that  come with it.Anyone looking for a place to stay whilst visiting Manhattan and Brooklyn need look no further.
37505	22790229	41958	5348144	Quentin & Claire	Great stay in NYC, Susan has been very welcoming, giving us tips and advices when we needed it, apartment is very clean and convenient, location great - seize it if you can!
37505	23229023	41968	257874	Matt	Gorgeous apartment near all the cool night spots in south Williamsburg. Comfy, quiet, and Susan is very accommodating!
37505	23569802	41978	8950652	Marcella	We want to come back!!!The one in New York was one of the best trip in my life! When I wrote to Susan that was my first experience with airbnb, she explained me everything so good that I choose her also for this reason...Was like my mom,simply perfect since the beginning! The room was amazing (and the bathroom as well, with all the facilities that you need) and the apartment something more!!!It was also very warm, it was very important there because it was so cold outside!You cannot miss it! Susan & Marco suggested us what to do in the area,how to reach the subway and the best places to have dinner and all their suggestions were perfect! They made our vacation something really unforgettable! Williamsburg,were they live,is a very nice portion that you should visit: there is also a nice public garden from where you can admire New York city and a wonderful cafe to see the skyline and you will be speechless for the beauty...I really recommend to stay with them and I hope to come back as soon as possible!!!
37505	26697891	42052	25866654	Kathy	Susan provided a large, comfortable space in a great location. Her apartment is a few minutes from midtown Manhattan by train and in a good neighborhood in Brooklyn. Susan is readily available to answer' questions.
37505	27815684	42075	24989217	Meghdad	I had an amazing experience staying with Susan and Marco. They are both friendly and kind. I was able to have my own privacy while counting on their support when I had questions. Everytime before leaving the house Susan would help me with finding the right direction as  well as giving suggestions on what locations to visit. On my last day in Brooklyn I felt a little bit sick and Susan very kindly made me some tea.I'll definitely visit them again, not only for the lovely house and location, but for returning their kindness and generosity. 
37505	28099803	42080	17003024	Nan    Nan	Susan helped us everything!her place is amazing close to everywhere you can walk to Bedford street within 10mins.she recommends many best places for us.i would definitely come back to her next time!
37505	28422648	42086	8160572	Paula	Susan and Mario were great hosting my sister and I during our short visit to NYC. The apartment is just like the pictures. It is in a great location, near 2 metro stations, just 20 min from Manhattan,  and there are tons of restaurants and market nearby. I'd definitely come back!
37505	28542186	42088	15862907	Carolina	El barrio es muy lindo. Hay muchos restaurantes y bares en el Ã¡rea y el metro estÃ¡ muy cerca. La habitaciÃ³n tiene buen tamaÃ±o, bastante amplia para nyc, y el baÃ±o privado lo hace muy cÃ³modo. Los anfitriones se portaron muy amables. No tuvimos ninguna queja.  
37505	29285167	42100	26490734	Keri	My boyfriend and I stayed with Susan and Marco over Easter and our stay was very pleasant. Their flat was ideal as it wasn't far from Manhattan (15minutes by subway ) and Williamsburg in general is a cool neighbourhood with lots of funky bars/restaurants nearby. Their flat was nicely decorated and furnished with a huge bed that that was incredibly comfortable to fall into after a long days walking! Regarding the bed, complete comfort is guaranteed! Their flat was always warm and cosy and we had our own privacy. What we liked about Susans flat was that we couldnt hear any outside noise.To conclude I would recommend this flat to anyone who doesnt mind being 'a little outside the centre ,' and for those who wish to use it as a place to sleep and go. Due to the fact that the couple work from home, the living room forms part of their office area which may not suit some people.Nonetheless this did not affect us as we left early morning and returned late at night! 
37505	35208331	42171	30433624	Eloi	Absolutely brilliant experience! Susan and Marco are great hosts, the house is lovely and ideally located in Williamsburg (only a short subway ride to Manhattan) with plenty of great bars and cafes nearby.I strongly recommend it for anyone who wants to have a pleasant stay in New York with nice and helpful lodgers.
37505	36856179	42187	28397926	Anne-Chantal	Nous avons passÃ© un excellent sÃ©jour chez Susan et Marco. L'appartement trÃ¨s confortable est situÃ© dans un quartier oÃ¹ vous trouverez toujours un bon resto pour vous restaurer et des boutiques branchÃ©es. Le lit est incroyablement bon et la chambre dÃ©corÃ©e avec goÃ»t. Et prendre son petit dÃ¨jeuner sur la terrasse fleurie...excellents souvenirs... ainsi que les moments passÃ©s avec nos hÃ´tes toujours prÃªts Ã  nous rendre service, nous donner des conseils de promenade et Ã  discuter avec nous ( malgrÃ© notre mauvais anglais!). C'Ã©tait mon premier sÃ©jour Ã  NY et je suis ravie de cette expÃ©rience Airbnb. Je n'ai pas vu passer ces 5 jours Ã  Brooklyn et je reviendrai avec grand plaisir chez Susan.
37505	40929878	42219	30074836	Molly	We had a great experience staying with Susan! The apartment was beautiful and kept very clean, and the terrace was a great place to relax after a long day. I would definitely recommend this listing! Thanks again Susan :)
37505	45784984	42253	23843314	Francesca	Just returned from an amazing 10 day stay with Susan and Marco. Their apartment is great, incredibly stylish and with all the right amenities (the bed is fab, I slept like a log). The location is perfect both to enjoy Williamsburg and its bar/restaurant scene and to get to other key places in NYC. Susan and Marco are very friendly and discreet hosts, they made me feel at home at all times. I would definitely recommend this place and I'm hoping to be back next year. 
37505	47454876	42266	29193877	Sue	Susan and Marco were our guests. The apartment was beautiful and very accurate to its description. Williamsburg is very interesting and the apartment was close to shops, bars, cinema etc. Our room was spacious and we had our own bathroom fascilities. 
37505	48439975	42273	15768	Elizabeth	Wonderful place and hosts. Spent 4 nights there with my mom and we had a great time. Excellent location for exploring Williamsburg and super easy to get into Manhattan. Thanks Susan!
37505	49329921	42280	41116464	Laura	This place is the perfect location if you you're looking to stay in one of the best restaurant neighborhoods in Brooklyn, everything is walking distance and easy. The actual apartment is clean, comfortable, quiet and accessible. We spent very little time here but when we were we slept well, as the bed is comfortable and the room is extremely quiet for NYC. The hosts gave us a lot of privacy but if we needed anything or had any questions they were more then helpful! 
37505	50745425	42291	36629924	David	We loved the apartment and the neighborhood it is in; lots of restaurants and friendly people. It is an easy walk to the subway. The apartment is lovely and clean. The bed is comfortable. The hosts are good people. 
37505	51731194	42301	42345791	Anna	"My bf and I had an estremely pleasant stay with Susan and Marco. Their loft is amazing! Clean, silent and adorned with beautiful ""sculptures"" made out of mechanical pieces and film canisters.  The bed in our room was wonderfully comfortable -- we wish we had an identical one in our house! A remarkable feature is the private bathroom, not available at most other airbnb accommodations in NY. The apartment is super close to the JMZ and only 10 min to the L train. From the apartment you can reach Downtown in 20 min, and Midtown in 30 min. The East River ferry to both Downtown and Midtown is also conveniently located at 10 min walking distance from the Susan and Marco's place. We highly recommend this accommodation!"
37505	52578975	42308	12379293	Georgia	We had a lovely stay in Williamsburg at Susan and Marco's place, which was exactly as described and pictured in the listing. The room was extremely comfortable and we slept very well. It was great to have a private bathroom and access to the kitchen when needed, although with so many fabulous restaurants, bars and cafe's on the doorstep we were out and about most of the time. The location was excellent and we enjoyed exploring Williamsburg and used the ferries and subway to go further afield without any difficulty. 
37505	52955024	42311	23200234	Sally	We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Susan and Marco. They were kind & welcoming hosts. We were in town while my boyfriend ran the NYC marathon, and this was the perfect place to get quality rest before the big race - we had our own spacious (and amazingly decorated!) room with a very big, comfortable bed & bathroom which was very enjoyable. We definitely recommend!
37505	54031327	42323	2122095	Joe	Susan was a great host. Recommended a tasty bagel place right around the corner. Her partner stayed up late when we arrived to let us in. Williamsburg itself is really nice with great trendy bars everywhere
37505	54894815	42333	33292761	Sophie	We had a really great time at Susan's apartment! It was all we needed: very well located in Williamsburg, comfy and only 7min far from the train station. Susan and Marco were very kind, helpful and gave us very good addresses in the neighborhood. Their apartment is very cosy, super clean and the huge bed is perfect to relax after a long day! The private bathroom is perfect too! We really enjoyed our stay, thank you again!
37505	55469678	42339	48536978	Karimoto	The location was perfect! I really appreciate that room was very clean and comfortable! I wish I could came back here again! I recommend you guys:)
37505	56247957	42349	12251346	Carsten	Everything was just as expected, we would return anytime!
37505	58055481	42369	50688390	Steve	Susan was very welcoming to my boyfriend and I, and we were very happy with the amount of privacy we were afforded. We really didn't spend too much time there except to sleep and shower,but the room and bed were very comfortable. The neighborhood has so much to offer, as far as restaurants and nightlife go. Williamsburg is a great area to explore and very convenient for getting to Manhattan by subway..  The space is just how it is described and appears in the photos. I would definitely recommend staying  here.
37505	62713481	42416	31510205	Jason	Susan and Marco were great hosts. We had a bit of trouble getting from Penn station (note: don't use the subway with bags!) but Susan was there waiting for us to welcome us with a cup of tea. The flat is beautifully decorated with subtle (and not-so-subtle) nods to the film industry everywhere. It feels homely and museum-like at the same time.The room is comfy - the bed is the centrepiece. There's central heating all around so you won't be cold.The location is the heart of Brooklyn, so you won't be short of things to do or places to eat (even if, like us, you stayed here in the depths of winter!)Thanks Susan - very pleasant stay.
37505	66095265	42448	43557520	Zuhaib	We had an amazing time at Susans .. Such a lovely place to be at right in the middle of everything .. The room was really comfortable and susan made us feel at home .. I would certainly recommend her place considering the level of comfort which is outstanding ..
37505	66469730	42451	27155622	Donna	We had the nicest trip to Brooklyn and Susan and Marco's lovely apartment. Location: perfect...easy walk or subway ride to anywhere.Host: just lovely. We didn't arrive until 11 pm because of traffic from Baltimore...but Susan just welcomed us, and then cheerfully went down to the street to move her car up a couple of feet so that we could fit our car in on the street(free parking and you don't have to move your car-unheard of!).Bed and bath: The king size bed with memory foam mattress was such a respite after a long day of walking...and the private bath was so nice. I honestly find it awkward to share a bath with strangers.We weren't around much but I will stay there again...Susan and Marco were very friendly, which we appreciated. We in turn, tried not to make any noise for them, as the apartment outside our bedroom is somewhat open concept. There are a several great looking restaurants around the corner (Pies and Thighs looked incredibly popular)...and it's open late!
37505	67589906	42459	13541167	Daniela	My husband and I really enjoyed our stay at Susan's place. Our room and bathroom were big and clean (completely private)The house is very nice and clean. Susan was very nice and flexible during the check-in and check-out.I totally recommend this place! Susan and Marco, thank you :) 
37505	72304229	42491	55019972	Dieu	I believe that other 70+ reviews had explained this well. Susan is a extremely nice person that greeted us nicely upon arrival. She took her time to ensure that we have everything we need. The place itself is amazing.  Decorated with art pieces and little inventions, the atmosphere of the place was 10/10. the room we stayed was very spacious and clean. we even had our private bathroom.  This is the first time I felt that I would love to decorate my house like this in the future. Also the location of the place is the best, right next to the williamsburg bridge. 15mins to manhattan. oh did I mention that peter luger is 5 mins away walking distance?  I strongly recommend this place to anyone:)
37505	73473847	42498	6108182	Deborah	The listing description was pretty accurate.  I assumed that the private bathroom adjoined the bedroom but it didn't.  That was an assumption on my part.  When I arrived, I found myself in a place of business and felt confused and awkward as there were people there working right outside the bedroom but only that first afternoon.  Susan encouraged me to feel free to park my car on the street and she was right.  It was fine for the 2 days and free!  The accommodations themselves were very clean, comfortable and classy.  Everything was great including a full closet!   The location was fantastic and the price was very fair for what i had.  I did not get a welcoming feeling.  The rest was good.
37505	82622069	42549	9310281	Marie & Fred	The host canceled this reservation 48 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
37505	83019894	42551	14343380	Mark	Susan's place was great. Located perfectly in Williamsburg, close to the subway and only a short walk from many great eateries. Susan and Marco were great hosts and very accommodating. They live and work in the apartment but we're respectful of our space and privacy. We would happily stay there again.
37505	99650635	42618	55019972	Dieu	Great experience and awesome location!
37505	102265667	42630	12867330	Paolo	Host gentili ed affabili, Susan e Marco sono disponibili se avete necessitÃ , ma allo stesso tempo rispettosi della privacy dell'ospite.Location ottima, ad appena 500 m dalla fermata subway Marcy: senza cambiare treno si arriva in 20 min. o poco piÃ¹ a Midtown Manhattan! Il palazzo Ã¨ davvero silenzioso, ma non lontano dall'area animata di Williamsburg, ed ha un'ampia terrazza. Il letto Ã¨ grande e supercomodo, le tende spesse alla finestra garantiscono un vero buio per chi, come noi, non gradisce il passaggio della luce all'alba; infine il bagno ad uso esclusivo degli ospiti aggiunge valore a questo BnB (vi sfido a trovare camera con bagno a Manhattan a questo prezzo). Uso cucina per fare colazione (l'host Marco Ã¨ italiano e permette di usare la sua moka: al vicino C-Town supermarket su Havemeyer trovate il caffÃ¨ Lavazza... non vi mancherÃ  il caffÃ¨ all'italiana la mattina;-). Insomma: ottima soluzione per contenere il budget senza rinunciare alle comoditÃ  ed alla privacy.Ci tornerei senza esitazione...P.S.: fatevi dare dall'host il numero del car service per JFK, spenderete meno che in taxi! Grazie Marco: 42$ mancia inclusa (35+tip), molto meno che all'arrivo con taxi cab ;-)
37505	104130962	42638	9737229	Nicoline	Susan was a very friendly and accommodating host. Her loft is in a great location in Williamsburg, surrounded by convenient eats and sweet shops. Easy walk to the L and JMZ lines for access to Manhattan. I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet place to stay in Brooklyn!
37505	105160996	42643	5952342	Ali	Susan was the perfect host.Communication before check - in was swift and easy. The apartment is just as it has been photographed. Full of character, heigh ceilings, exposed brick walls - gorgeous. It was immaculately clean, and having your own bathroom was a complete luxury. The bed is possibly the most comfortable thing I have ever slept on. No exaggeration! On leaving Susan was kind enough to take the bedding off for me to take a photograph of the label of the mattress and bedding! A lovely rest-bite from my friends couch. The room itself has everything you need. Huge wardrobe space, bedside lamp for reading, lovely wide telly, speedy wifi etc.. The location was great for me. A stones throw from the M J Z trains, and 10 minute walk to the L train - all getting you into manhattan in 10minutes. It's in the heart of Williamsburg surrounded by thrift shops, bars, cafes & restaurants etc. There was also a gorgeous outdoor decking space, but I didn't actually stay long enough to get out there!What I was looking for was a peaceful, cool space in the middle of everything with lovely hosts and this is what I got and more.I will definitely be back to stay with Susan & Marco - thank you both!

The bedroom is confortable, large and quieter than many in big cities. Appreciated private bathroom beside, functionally arranged in the available space. Our hosts welcomed us with courtesy and discretion. Every morning, we could enjoy a cup of excellent Italian expresso before leaving, sometimes with one of them. However, due to their busy agenda, they may not be always as available as one could wish for advice, so it is better to prepare your trip before leaving, as we did. All in all, a very recommendable place.

37505	109916102	42666	6209850	Kenneth	This was a great apartment in which to be based to explore Williamsburg as well as Manhattan. There's lots to see in the neighbourhood, and plenty of cafes and restaurants to visit . The subway stations are a short walk away. The apartment was beautifully decorated with mechanical pieces and film references. Susan respected our privacy, and there's a large curtain drawn across the living spaces during dark hours for that. We enjoyed our stay!
37505	110787323	42671	14507793	Claire	We had a lovely time staying at Susan's apartment in Williamsburg. The room was a good size and it was great to have our own bathroom as well. Williamsburg is pretty different from Manhattan but with easy access to Manhattan, we enjoyed seeing a different side to New York.
37505	111770829	42675	50018430	Daniel	Susan gave us all the support we needed to feel at home!The location is great for those who want to enjoy the  bedford ave and super simple to get in Manhattan.The bed and the shower are really awesome and make a  huge difference in the stay.If you are planning hit Brooklyn, you definitely should  stay in susans.
37505	116558445	42705	101321235	Sam	Had a very nice time at Susan's. Big and clean room, nice private bathroom. Close to the metro to go to Manhattan. I would definatly reccomend this place
37505	120733989	42715	104073658	Gavin	Host was great, communication before and right up to arrival was spot on, allowed us to drop bags of early before check in time, location for price is great, so easy to get about on the subway (weeks subway pass only $31), local station under 5 min walk away. Room and bathroom was great (better than some hotels you pay over the odds for). Would recommend this to anyone visiting New York.
6725	49663340	42282	9671572	Ava	500 words are not enough for us to say how much we love Erin and her lovely apartment. This is the best experience I had ever have!1. The ApartmentThe apartment is spacey! Very clean, stylish and cozy. Erin is such a good host, so thoughtful and sweet. We were provided with plenty of A+ quality towels, and these amazing Shampoo, Conditioner and Shower Gel - point this out because of how great they made our hair feel :DThe kitchen is full equipped. If you wanna cook, it will be a delight. We made ourselves coffee every morning with the grounded coffee bean Erin suggested and prepared for us, and we loved it.2. The ExperienceCheck in and check out is so easy and convenient! Erin accommodated all of our need. We landed so early in the morning, but we were able to check in right away when we got there. Once we arrived, she had print-outs ready for us. Wifi, restaurant recommendation, energy contact and etc, all on the paper. This is exceptional! Erin and Luke made us feel welcome and we always had pleasant conversations.And when we check out, she allows us to put our luggages in the place so we could go out again, and enjoy ourselves freely.3. The AreaThe location is super convenient! M, J, L three different subway lines are 10mins away. There's a cute little market 1 min from the house. Many good food places around the area as well! We had such good time staying here, and we are so glad that we found Erin's place! 
6725	50102129	42286	32316388	McCauley	We had such an amazing time staying at Erin's apartment. Check in/ check out was super easy. Good location. Beautiful, spacious and clean apartment. Fully equipped kitchen if you like to cook like myself, we especially loved the French press! We never got the chance to meet Erin in person but she was a wonderful host! She even left us a loaf of fresh bread from her shop! So sweet of her! Would definitely recommend staying here! 
6725	50659623	42290	32940340	Linda	Excellent,  retreat in the big city.  Little luxuries were a nice touch.  Good size for 2 adults and 2 kids.
6725	50944517	42293	4565133	Lucy	This was a great place! Super clean and cozy, near the train, friendly host. couldn't have asked for more!
6725	51734591	42301	27088566	AriÃ«tte	Erin's apartment is great! It's spacious, has a modern interior (with original art on the wall!) and is well equiped in every way with a very nice personal touch. We loved the apartment! And Erin, her husband Luke and daughter too! They made us feel welcome, were helpfull to us when needed and thoughtfull as well. When it suddenly got cold, they provided us instantly with extra heaters, so kind.We received a tastefull welcomingbasket when we arrived. They just started but are very quick learners I think, they are really involved.Their neighbourhood is lively and gives you a good feeling about living in Brooklyn/Bushwick. It's a 10 minute walk to both Halsey-stations (J&L). Erin has a book with tips of where to eat/drink in the neighbourhood. There are Deli's on every corner. We had a great time in NYC but were glad we could retreat in our oasis of rest when we came 'home'. Great place to be!!
6725	51974813	42302	41132005	Alex	Staying in Brooklyn was great. We loved the place! It was very clean and nice! 
6725	52410314	42306	21619787	Eitan	Erin is a great hostess and her place is amazing. It is really a home away from home.Highly recommended.
6725	52710121	42309	4427635	Travis	Erin's place was fantastic!  Very cute and comfortable.  Easy walk to the subway.  I easily found street parking nearby.  I would definitely recommend this place and I would stay hear again.
6725	53340280	42316	20680553	Pauline	This is a very good place . The apartement is amazing ! I just want to say Go to all People see my commentsAnd erin is the Best. â?º
6725	54440112	42328	4573525	Iie-Mall	Erin was very welcoming, and quick to answer any questions we had. We had to make some changes to our reservation prior to our arrival, but Erin was very accommodating. The communication was very pleasant. We had a lovely Brooklyn experience. There were delis and laundromats everywhere and a larger supermarket near the station. The place was quite near to 2 metro stations, so the location was quite convenient. 
6725	54594332	42330	12270717	Celia	Ours stay at Erin's apartment was lovely! The place was really clean and super adorable--just as the photos indicate. Erin provided us with a handy little guide to good places around the neighborhood and a couple of snacks to welcome us. Though we didn't need anything during our stay, she was right upstairs and assured us she'd be available should we need something. Great location (10 min walk to subway), great apartment--highly recommend! 
6725	55607918	42341	45111175	Juliana	Erin como anfitriona nos brindo mucho apoyo y ayudo con los horarios del vuelo independiente a la hora de entrada, fueron muy amables y agradable la estadia.El departamento fue totalmente acorde a la descripcion, estaba completamente equipado, se encontraba cerca de todos los medios necesarios.Fue una muy buena experiancia, recomendariamos el lugar para cualquier otra persona interesada.
6725	55786038	42344	23211702	Lisa	What a lovely apartment and wonderful host!  Erin left us a treat for when we arrived, which was much appreciated since we needed a little snack before our dinner reservations.  The apartment was easy to locate, there was easy access to free parking (we were able to park right in front of the building) and everything was extremely clean and very comfortable.   The neighborhood is safe and there is access to stores if needed.  The subway is about a 10-15 minute walk but easy to locate.    Overall our experience was marvelous and Erin provided us with a welcoming comfortable space to call our own while visiting the area!  
6725	56299061	42350	11834846	Viktoria	We just loved the apartment! It's very clean, spacious and cozy. It is  beautifully decorated, with a lot of passion for detail. We even didn't understand that there are two rooms with two beds until a few days before our stay - so there is plenty of space. It is fully equipped and Erin provides many information. It might be a little bit louder at times as the apartment has quite thin walls but we didn't mind. It's a 12 minutes walk to the subway with a good connection to Manhattan. On our way to the subway we loved to stoped by at the Trans Am Cafe for a coffee or breakfast.Erin allowed us to let out bags in the apartment on our last day for two extra hours which was great. Thanks for having us!
6725	56394021	42351	48580785	Laura	This was such a beautiful place to stay.  The place was in perfect condition and was very warm and welcoming.  I highly recommend this great Airbnb.
6725	56847420	42357	34151494	Pedro	I had a great stay at the home of Erin, had all the necessities of life, all very clean, tidy and spacious; They were very polite and very respectful of our stay. Strongly recommended.
6725	57302070	42362	10975	Mark	This is a great apartment, well furnished and clean and just like the photos. There is also plenty of local info provided, like cafe & subway locations and a metro card. We didn't get to meet Erin but she was very helpful and left us a lovely treat for our arrival. We arrived late but had no trouble getting in on our own with Erin's instructions. It's in a good location, an easy walk to the subway and our favourite Trans Am for breakfast. We had a bit of noise from upstairs at times but nothing too bad and not too late. Overall we enjoyed our stay at Erin's and would definitely recommend it!
6725	57767648	42367	33604927	Paul	Lovely apartment, perfectly well equipped, comfortable and spotlessly clean, and exactly reflects the information provided in the website. We did not get to meet Erin but she was very welcoming and responsive.   Interesting neighbourhood and relatively good subway connection to Manhattan and elsewhere. Overall excellent experience. 
6725	58518153	42372	68498	Sam	We had a great (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication was very good and thereâ??s a entry keycode so no problem to arrive at unconventional hours. The apartment itself is extremely clean, comfortable, and very nicely decorated (a lot of care and attention has obviously gone into it). Location is a residential area but there are shops nearby and itâ??s a 10-15 minute walk to the Halsey St L train subway and a similar distance to some good local bars etc. Overall, one of the best airbnb apartments I have stayed at. Thanks!
6725	59007933	42374	7441339	Guy	Nice bright and airy apartment 12 mins walk from the subway, nice residential neighbourhood. Good wifi. Nice kitchen. Good shower. Comfy beds. Flexible arrival and departure times. All great!
6725	59382674	42379	50099822	Marie	Erin's apartment was clean and beautiful. We had very nice vacation there. 
6725	60268424	42390	9665408	Guillermo	Muy bueno el departamento de Erin, todo es igual como sale en las fotos e incluso mucho mejor. El barrio es bueno y tranquilo, si bien no el mejor de Brooklyn pero para una estadÃ­a corta sirve bastante bien.El barrio esta lleno de minimarkets donde puedes ir a comprar a casi cualquier hora del dÃ­a. Es una muy buena opciÃ³n. Guillermo AlarcÃ³nChile
6725	60587027	42394	3870085	Darcie	Erin's place was a lovely place to stay while visiting the city. It was the big blizzard and we were so happy we had such a cozy spot to stick it out. Great location, super clean and felt like a home. Erin wasn't around but he made sure all was okay and even arranged for someone to shovel, much appreciated. Couldn't be happier with our stay, would love to come back another time.
6725	61228692	42401	17720285	Erica	Erin left the lights on for us and left us some bananas. 
6725	61725418	42407	3005422	Yonis	The Airbnb was lovely, very welcoming. It had everything we could ask for. I would stay here again.
6725	62890275	42418	7260769	Alicia	Erin was a great host. Good communication before and during our trip. The apartment was lovely exactly as pictured and so spacious! A little further out than I had anticipated the closest subway is a 15 minute though. Erin was so very accommodating as we had a late return flight and she allowed us to leave our luggage there until necessary. So thanks Erin great stay!
6725	63060284	42420	42247946	Brooke	Erin's place is beautiful. She was super accommodating and everything is fresh and modern inside. There were beautiful little touches like good quality ground coffee and little chocolates left for us on the kitchen counter. There was also a folder left that had all sorts of helpful info and recommendations. The place is decorated beautifully. We couldn't fault it.
6725	64281122	42431	20551369	Sofiane	A place that allowed us to spend a wonderful holiday, Erin was present for all of our questions. The neighbourhood is very quiet and the people are really friendly.
6725	65002900	42439	4350807	Marcel	Erin was a great host! The communication was very friendly. We had a little problem with the shower but Erin and her husband fixed it in no time. As we arrived, Erin even provided some organic food, fresh eggs and coffee. :)The apartment is very well equipped, escpecially if you're looking for a place to stay for four grown-ups with two seperate bedrooms. The neighbourhood is ok and you'll find some grocery stores nearby. Walking to the subway takes approx 10-15 minutes. From there it's 30 minutes to midtown Manhattan, which we thought is quite a long trip. We really loved the apartment and had a great stay there, but we'd pick a place closer to Manhattan next time. If you're looking for a really nice, clean, cosy yet inexpensive place for up to four people (and you don't bother the distance to Manhattan) â?? this is the place to go! Thanks for the great stay. Selma, Laura, Mathies & Marcel
6725	65883594	42446	25493464	Hanna	Eine tolle Wohnung mit allem was man brauch! Erin und ihr Mann sind tolle Gastgeber und helfen sehr zuvorkommend bei Problemen! Gerne kommen wir wieder!
6725	66969521	42455	42404743	Niamh	The apartment was very cosy and welcoming and Erin had left some lovely treats for our arrival. It was a sanctuary to return to after a busy day in the city. Erin was also very accommodating with our flight times which made our life much easier. Would happily return to Bushwick and Erin's apartment again ! 
6725	68070981	42462	47908721	Laura	We enjoyed our stay, apartment was really nice! Erin was so friendly and everything went well.
6725	68547681	42465	3420057	Martin	We had a great time. The apartment was as nice as shown on the pictures. Erin is an amazing host.
6725	69408036	42471	46015844	Carine	Logement spacieux, propre, agrÃ©able et cosy Ã  l'identique des photos. Bus Ã  proximitÃ© et Metro pas si loin.nous avons apprÃ©cier la sympathie d'Erin et toutes ses petites attentions. 
6725	69672912	42472	1648549	Joan & Randy	The apartment is gorgeous! Everything is new, bathroom is nice and roomy. Very easy to access with the keypad on the door. Our bed was comfortable and I loved having a second bedroom for my stepdaughter instead of a pull out couch (if we had opted for a one bedroom). There is a bit of a walk to the subway, so check on that before you book if that's an issue. We took a cab back from Williamsburg and the fare was minimal. This is a great value for the price!!
6725	70829734	42481	35720745	Elisabeth	This is a lovely apartment and really super if one wants to explore both Manhattan and Brooklyn, as we did. We had a great first time in New York much thanks to this great airbnb. We loved it. So clean and fresh. Erin and her husband were very nice hosts. We felt very welcomed. We would definately recommend this place. 
6725	72045997	42490	46219081	Paulina	Before our trip we contacted Erin a couple of times with questions and she was always very helpfull and gave us many great tips. Her home was as described, spacious rooms, clean and and everything was tidy. There was food in the fridge and even some fresh fruit. There was no t.v. or a radio, some people like the quiet but if you don't keep that in mind. We had plenty of clean towels and the bath/shower was really nice. Erin arranged a car service to pick us up and take us to the airport on our way back and we could leave our luggage in the basement after check out until the evening when we were picked up. Erin's street was nice and friendly but some were a bit rough around the edges. We would usually come back between 22:00 and 22:30 in the evening and most streets would be empty.
6725	72347672	42492	43167339	Jillian	The space was just s described, if not better. Super clean, everything you might need for a stay. Beautiful kitchen and bathroom. Quiet neighborhood. About a 10-15 minute walk to a subway that can get you just about anywhere in Brooklyn and Manhattan. I never met Erin in person but she was very quick to respond and very accommodating. Would love to stay again. 
6725	72669086	42494	27644900	Crystal	The apartment is sparkling clean and perfect for two couples.  Great spot!
6725	72838826	42494	34753280	Paule	L'appartement est parfait : propre, trÃ¨s bien Ã©quipÃ©, cosy, dÃ©corÃ© avec goÃ»t, on s'y sent bien. Erin a rÃ©pondu Ã  toutes nos questions et a parfaitement su nous aider, je la remercie encore. Seul bÃ©mol : Bien que facile Ã  trouver, l'appartement est assez Ã©loignÃ© par rapport au mÃ©tro (15 minutes de marche). Je recommanderais cet appartement pour des personnes qui souhaitent visiter Brooklyn. 
6725	73718643	42499	63891514	Jessica	The apartment was so cute and cozy!  We loved the beds, very comfortable, and the fully stocked kitchen was very handy.  We found it very easy to get around Brooklyn and to anywhere in Manhattan from this location.  Overall we had a wonderful stay at Erin's Airbnb. 
6725	74144682	42503	19319056	Zijian	Very nice interior finishes, the host is very responsive; I had a great time with my parents here. 
6725	74759366	42506	43736220	Lydon	Beautiful apartment with comfortable beds and large living space.
6725	75188527	42509	29437975	Chenlu	Erin is friendly and responsive throughout the reservation. The listing is within walkable distance to the nearest subway station. The rooms are quite cosy, which I like it very much. Everything is pretty good.
6725	75283627	42510	49834382	Alex	Listing was accurate. Lovely home. Perfect for us.
6725	76508124	42517	53222309	Stephanie	Super happy with our first Airbnb experience. Apartment was exactly like the pictures if not better! Easy to get around. Host and partner were fantastic.
6725	78467483	42527	17692263	Parker & Missy	Erin's place in Brooklyn was wonderful! Very conveniently located near the subway and not too far from a really cool neighborhood with plenty of restaurant options. The house had plenty of space for the four adults that stayed there. They had everything we could need and more to make our stay comfortable. We would definitely stay there again if ever back In the area. Erin is also very responsive to our messages before and during our stay! I would highly recommend this AirBNB!
6725	78669271	42529	628691	Andrea	Erin was absolutely wonderful.  I needed to drop my bags off and she was kind enough to let me drop them at her home and even put cold drinks into the fridge to stay cold. She was also knowledgable on the area and all around a lovely host. The space itself was impeccable. Roomy, bright and beautiful it was as functionally comfortable as it was aesthetic. There is a water purifier in the fridge, a lovely patio area, all the basics that you need. My only regret is that we only had about 20 hours and really spent no time in the house. I will definitely stay with Erin again, hopefully for a longer stint. 
6725	80527717	42539	54578670	Daniel	The apartmet is very nice, clean and modern. All was arranged to make easier our stay there. Great place to stay while visiting Brooklyn, NYC or both.
6725	81152179	42542	48786141	Chris	A beautiful place to stay, very clean, modern and comfortable. The place has everything you need and a lot of effort has gone into making it perfect for guests. Erin and her husband were great hosts and very welcoming.
6725	82419043	42548	50627633	Tom	Big thanks to Erin for sharing this wonderful apartment! It is in easy location of the subway and plenty of shops nearby. Erin was great making sure our stay was as pleasant as possible. We had a fantastic time during our stay.
6725	83309807	42553	15893209	Michael	Hello there. Erin's place was exactly as described. Everything was clean, comfortable and all communication was clear with helpful hints abounding. The apartment is well into Brooklyn, but you are in Manhattan in 20 minutes and Erin gave really helpful options of where to go nearby and further afield. Made the whole trip a really relaxing experience.
6725	84663854	42559	42256528	Antoine	TrÃ¨s bel appartement, idÃ©al pour se reposer aprÃ¨s les longues journÃ©es de marche dans NY et ses environs. Erin est une hÃ´te qui prend soin de ses convives et est Ã  votre Ã©coute pour la moindre question. je recommande grandement !
6725	84898251	42560	13244267	Kyle	Perfect apartment, in a nice neighborhood.Erin was extremely accommodating, I was only there one night but thoroughly enjoyed it. Thank you Erin
6725	86286218	42566	46147352	Marleen	When we arrived we met Luke in the front garden. He gave us a very good feeling because the taxidriver told us that the neighbourhood wasn't very safe. Erin brought us some cheese from her shop, so very nice.
6725	89918673	42581	25221561	NaÃ«ma	TrÃ¨s bel appartement, encore mieux que sur les photos. Grand et propre avec toutes les commoditÃ©s nÃ©cessaire. Erin a Ã©tÃ© prÃ©sente tout au long de notre sÃ©jour pour nous aider et rÃ©pondre Ã  nos questions. Il est trÃ¨s bien localisÃ© Ã  15min de 3 diffÃ©rentes lignes de mÃ©tro. Le voisinage est sur et amical. Je recommande l'appartement et je reviendrais chez Erin si j'ai l'occasion de revenir Ã  Brooklyn. 
6725	92156253	42589	47875534	Beate	The apartment is very tastefully furnished. Everything is clean. The beds are comfortable and the kitchen is well stocked. Everything worked. We particularly appreciated some basic food in the fridge and the cupboards which meant that we did not have to go out and shop right away. The hosts provide a welcome pack with very useful information about the apartment, the neighborhood, and the city. Access to Manhattan is really easy - just a few minutes walk to the subway and direct connections to all parts of town. We had a great time and loved everything about our stay. We definitely recommend the apartment and would love to come back ourselves.
6725	92612408	42591	3756789	Hamilton	Super easy check-in, really comfortable and clean apartment, and very kind hosts.  Thanks for having us!
6725	94493014	42597	22614240	Monique	Prima plek, erg fijn groot, mooi aangekleed en verzorgd, uitgebreide keuken met grote koelkast. Airco! Welkom met fles wijn, bak fruit, fris water. 2 prachtige kamers, groot, goede bedden, grote TV alles heel mooi en aan te bevelen. Loopafstand naar L train prima, dan ben je snel in manhattan. Winkels in de buurt voor boodschappen. 
6725	94978262	42599	24020352	Camille	Erin's apartment was perfect for our purposes, which was a film shoot. We paid a fair price for her apartment, and the apartment was perfectly decorated and clean. Erin was also communicative and helpful. 
6725	100325484	42621	11359645	Paul	Super Wohnung, sehr sauber, perfekt ausgestattet, sehr hilfsbereite nette Gastgeber, sehr gute Lage, gut ans U-Bahnnetz angebunden, besonders schÃ¶n war, dass man den Garten mitbenutzen durfte
6725	101330381	42625	40490782	Nico	Erin and her family were such great hosts! They were very friendly and accommodating with checking in our luggage early.  The place was clean and setup beautifully. We will stay at Erin's the next time we visit New York.  Thanks Erin :) 
6725	102940571	42632	56010104	Lena	We had a great time at erins place. The appartment is gorgeous and erin was much more than a good host. Bus and subway stops are close and itâ??s just a 30min ride to Manhattan.Couldnâ??t imagine a better place to stay in New York! Thanks Erin and Luke.
6725	103689087	42636	12190238	Scott	This apartment was a pure delight, very modern and extremely clean, quiet and comfortable! The area felt very friendly and safe and Erin was very helpful and flexible with any questions I had! I want to come back again already!
6725	104449417	42639	82685086	Leonie	The Check-in was really easy. As we walked in there was a quiet big room used as a living- and diningroom and there was a kitchen as well. The 2 bedrooms were really lovely furnished. At one bedroom you had an access to the backyard, which was pretty tall. You share the backyard with you upper neighbors. The only negative thing was you could hear everything through the wall, even from the upper neighbors. Apart from that, it was a very pleasant stay. Everything was perfect organized. They provided the full monty. Shampoo, showergel, conditioner, towels, hairdryer, a welcome gift, a folder with a lot of information with insider tips, even some food. The apartment was well cleaned and tidied up. We would definitely recommend this apartment and would love to stay there anytime we come back to NY. Thanks a lot to Erin!! 
6725	106223247	42647	11579627	Cathrine	We had a lovely stay in Erin's apartment. The flat was perfect for four persons. It was well equipped and nicely renovated. We loved the neighborhood with all its little marts and friendly people. We never met Erin but communication with her was easy and she replied quickly to our questions. Check in was super easy and we had the opportunity to leave our bags after check out time. Overall a very nice experience and visit.
6725	107695662	42654	55636756	Danielle	TrÃ¨s agrÃ©able sÃ©jour chez Erin et Luk.  L'appartement est tout Ã  fait conforme aux photos et au descriptif. Luk Ã©tait prÃ©sent pour nous accueillir.  Il a eu la gentillesse de commander notre taxi pour le retour Ã  l'aÃ©roport. Nous recommandons cet hÃ´te sans rÃ©serve. 
6725	109181339	42662	58590853	Jos	Very Nice staying there
6725	110040833	42666	62589586	Julie	Lovely Bushwgarden apartment! Beds were amazingly comfortable and amenities were top notch! 
6725	111593434	42674	59724259	Adela	"Die Einrichtung war genau so wie auf den Fotos. Es war sehr gut eingerichtet und sehr modern. Man hatte alles was man gebraucht hat und die ""Heizung"" hat auch sehr gut funktioniert. Es war sehr staubig und die BettwÃ¤sche war nicht sehr sauber. Die Nachbarschaft ist sehr laut, liegt aber eher daran dass die WÃ¤nde zu dÃ¼nn sind und man sie reden, tanzen und gehen hÃ¶rt. Also am Abend muss man sich nicht wundern wenn sie noch bis 1 oder 2 Uhr in der Nacht wach sind und laut sind. Die Lage war ganz in Ordnung. Es war sauber und die U-Bahn war nur 10 Minuten entfernt. Als sehr sicher wÃ¼rde ich die Gegend aber nicht bezeichnen. Hab mit den Nachbarn geredet und sie meinen, dass dieser Teil der Stadt langsam besser wird, bedeutet also dass es frÃ¼her nicht so sicher war. Die Kommunikation mit den Gastgebern hat sehr gut funktioniert und wir haben uns auch fast jeden Tag geschrieben. Als Willkommensgeschenk gab es eine Mappe, mit StadtplÃ¤nen, Anleitungen und Schokolade. In der nÃ¤he gibt es einen Supermarkt, aber der ist sehr teuer. WÃ¼rde allen Reisenden empfehlen Brot und Aufstrich aus ihrem Land mit zu nehmen. Kommt billiger. "
6725	112316117	42679	42606092	Aurelien	Erin is very pleasant, friendly and very helpful and maintained good communication throughout.She responded quickly and answered questions and queries promptly. She was also happy to call us a taxi!!Gorgeous, clean, spacious and comfortable flat which is also well equipped and very welcoming.Very useful house rule/guide book!Loved the Brooklyn area with easy reach to Manhattan (20mins by tube).I would definitely recommend Erin's flat and hosting to anyone wishing to visit New York 
6725	113158401	42684	5726861	Pieter	Very nice and spacious apartment. Stayed there with 4 adults and was perfect. Neighborhood doesn't feel too safe at night, however does offer some nice restaurants.Would recommend this to to others. 
6725	113721707	42687	42057354	Matthew	We loved this stay!  The property looks exactly like it does in the pictures and it was cozy and clean and perfect for our stay.  The beds especially got high marks from everyone. We really loved the neighborhood - and appreciate the recommendations Erin left in the welcome pack. (Pies & Thighs is worth the visit, folks!) All our communications were quick and easy, and Erin made check-in and check-out the easiest I've ever experienced with an AirBnB.  We all agreed that our next trip to New York/Brooklyn would be awesome if this place was available again! Thanks!
6725	114959044	42694	22879579	Laurien	Erin has a really nice apartment in Brooklyn! We enjoyed our stay very much. The beds were comfortable, the bathroom was clean. One minor disadvantage was that the place was very noisy. You can hear the upstairs neighbors very well. However, they were quiet around 9/9:30 pm so that was all fine! We would recommend this place if you're planning a trip to NY. 
6725	115795191	42700	17623806	Mona	Erins Wohnung ist sehr schÃ¶n,sauber und freundlich (URL HIDDEN) gibt wirklich nichts zu bemÃ¤ngeln.Der Kontakt mit Erin lief reibungslos und obwohl Bushwick ein wenig abseits von Manhattan liegt,ist man mit der Subway in ca 45 min dort.Wir kÃ¶nnen Erins Unterkunft nur empfehlen!!
6725	120017542	42710	26787594	Pauline	Nous avons adorÃ© l'appartement ! Propre, spacieux et confortable, il est joliment dÃ©corÃ©. Pour trouver un point nÃ©gatif, l'appartement n'est pas bien insonorisÃ© et des bruits extÃ©rieurs peuvent dÃ©ranger durant la nuit. Il est bien situÃ© Ã  10 minutes Ã  pied du mÃ©tro pour pouvoir visiter Manhattan. Erin nous a permis de laisser nos valises dans l'appartement le dernier jour en attendant notre vol. Merci pour tout !
6725	121688319	42722	7684803	Sara	We stayed for two nights at Erin's apartment. Everything went so smoothly. The apartment is very clean. She was very helpful and did not mind that we check out late on Sunday. Great experience! Would definitely book this apartment again.
6725	123519578	42733	73103480	Colin	Place was great and Erin was a great host!! Would definitely stay again.
6725	125461136	42740	63030816	Lobke	We had a really nice time at Erin's place! We will recommend it to our friends!
6725	126169179	42744	4435733	Kayla	Everything went pretty seamlessly. Getting into the apartment was smooth, we had everything we needed. We had a very early flight into Newark and Erin made sure that we could check in before 10am which made our travel day soooooo easy. Much appreciated!!! The only thing that was a negative about this place was the neighbors upstairs - they were very loud. Other than that everything went fabulous and the next time I need to work in Brooklyn I am definitely coming back! 
6725	128304603	42758	106944775	Doug	The Apartment was clean and well equipped. 2 bedroom were spacious and the beds were very soft and clean. Communication was good with owner. Very easy to get to subway and to get into city. Overall we had a very good stay!
6725	129411653	42765	30170740	Robin	Erin's place looks exactly like the photos. Very clean and cozy. Overall I had a great time. It's a 15 min walk to and from the subway which isn't too bad. The walls are thin so when the neighbors are playing music you can hear them from downstairs. This wasn't too much of a problem for us because we were rarely home. Also this only happened in the day time, at night I slept like a baby! Erin is also super flexible with check-ins and check-outs which was super awesome! I would definitely recommend Erin's place to someone else.
6725	130683645	42773	27420253	Jenny	Adorable backyard, comfy beds and blankets, and an amazing bodega half a block away. Heaven for the weekend. 
6725	131250823	42777	16019725	Luis	Perfecto, el apartamento es precioso, cÃ³modo y te sientes como en casa. La comunicaciÃ³n con Erin inmejorable, muy recomendado Ã©ste lugar. 
6725	132892748	42785	32305852	Daniel	Amazingly well taken care of space that is exactly as described. Gorgeous, quiet and clean. This sleeps 4 perfectly and affordably.
6725	135423454	42799	77466038	Marie-Theres	Erin's Wohnung war sauber und zweckgemÃ¤ss eingerichtet. Wir haben uns wÃ¤hrend unsern Ferien von knapp 2 Wochen darin sehr wohl gefÃ¼hlt. Er/sie hat uns fÃ¼r den Ferienstart einige Lebensmittel im KÃ¼hlschrank zum Verbrauch angeboten. Unsere RÃ¼ckfragen wurden sofort und klar beantwortet. Herzlichen Dank! Erin als Host(ess) ist eine empfehlenswerte Adresse!
6725	135847657	42800	98214548	Nate	Erin was wonderful and the place was great!
6725	137308972	42808	29362615	Camilo	Erin's place was more than great, super comfortable, clean, just like what we needed for our days in New York ! Was definitely more than what we expected, they had coffee for us for this crazy snowstorm we got while in there. Thank you for your hospitality and will definitely be back ! 
6725	139274173	42818	109150703	Wang	The house is so great!

37367	88407840	42575	44095190	Lucie-Lan	Excellent sÃ©jours chez Janine.Janine n'a pas dormi dans l'appartement pendant 4 nuits pour nous laisser plus d'intimitÃ©.Elle nous a toujours informÃ© de son programme quand elle passait prendre ses affaires. L'emplacement est parfait aussi bien pour visiter brooklyn que Manathan. A seulement 3 min  a pied du mÃ©tro et 1 stop de Manathan. Les restaurants et bars autour de l'appartement sont vraiment tops et Janine nous a donnÃ© plein de conseils. Je recommande ce airbnb pleinement !

The apartment was clean and Janine left some towels out for us. I never met Janine but she was helpful and very quick to respond when we first arrived. Great spot to stay.

37367	99869233	42619	66665685	Jerome	This apartment is so conveniently place in Williamburg that we didn't even take a taxi once, Everything was pretty much walking distance. Overall, me and my friends really enjoyed the apartment. Thanks again Janine and Gwen!!! 
37367	103826658	42637	39555790	Kate	Janine was a great host, the apartment was in a great location and very clean. Convenient walk to Brooklyn Bowl, the subway and Best Pizza, which really was the best. This was the perfect place for our short stay. 
37367	104177960	42638	8439006	Amy	Our stay with Janine was fabulous, she was very helpful and her place was in the best location for the events we were attending for the weekend. Super cute and super clean room. The subway is only a block away so we just walked everywhere we needed to go and Oslo coffee on the other block was delicious and convenient. Looking forward to our next stay her in Brooklyn.
37367	104627785	42640	78206151	Jesse	Perfect location, very close to the L train. Janine was so helpful with our late night arrival, made everything very easy. 100% recommend and will use again next time in New York!

37367	107543307	42653	8067208	Hernan	Really well located apartment, in the heart of Williamsburg. Second floor and no elevator, but it is not hard to go upstair. We met Janine the last date but she helped us since first day.
37367	110983891	42672	92414018	Stefania	Janine Ã¨ stata molto accogliente e disponibile. Abbiamo avuto occasione di vederla solo al nostro arrivo e, durante tutto il soggiorno, ci ha lasciato la completa disponibilitÃ  della sua casa, restando comunque sempre a disposizione per qualsiasi nostra richiesta. La casa si trova in un isolato tranquillo di un quartiere molto vivace, pieno di negozi, locali e buoni ristoranti, comodo come base per raggiungere New York e visitare le altre zone di Brooklyn. Assolutamente consigliato!
37367	111520241	42674	33281849	Torben	Great Neighborhood and a very good located appartment. We didn't met Janine in person, but it was just a perfect communication. 100% recommendation!

37367	114830073	42694	26994302	Matteo	Janine's apartment was a perfect choice for my first time around Williamsburg: her place is literally 2 mn walking from the main road in the area where all restaurants, cafes and shops are (URL HIDDEN) well as being a block away from a direct tube hop to Manhattan. Janine's been very accommodating in terms of checking time and area tips. Would definitely stay again.
37367	115533669	42699	93775796	Scott	Cozy apartment and great location only a few blocks from the subway.  Perfect for a nice weekend in Williamsburg!
37367	115983588	42701	3586561	Nolan	Janine's place was really conveniently located and just what my friends and I needed for a weekend exploring Brooklyn. Though we never met in person, Janine was responsive and helpful throughout the entirety of our trip. 
37367	116220602	42702	2902757	Judith	Janine was right on time to meet us with the keys and let us in to her space, which we appreciated.  We loved the location, including on-street parking!  The bed was comfy and it was nice and quiet for sleeping.
37367	117348940	42710	30937650	Asaph	Great location (easy access to subway). Nice and helpful host. Not fancy, good value.

37367	123096516	42731	51182045	Sara	Janine's place is perfectly located and very accommodating. She is incredibly responsive and I would 100% recommend. 
37367	124681307	42737	17399833	Elodie	This place is really awesome. Good localisation (less than 2 min of Bedford ave station), clean and janine is really friendly. We spend good times overthere. She answered almost immediatly when we had questions on airbnb. So it's definitly a good choice When you stay in NYC
37367	126984410	42750	40970484	Charmi	Lovely place. We had an event in Manhattan. It was really easy to hop on the L and get to this listing and hop on the L back.It was easy to pick up the key from a keycafe
37367	131552330	42778	42805432	Anthony	Janine's place is perfect for a Williamsburg experience. It's spacious & has just what you need for a visit to NYC. Communication for key pickup/drop off where great & parking was free for the weekend just under the apartment!
37367	132883549	42785	110882544	Bobby	Janine's location was perfect for dining, night life, and travel. The place was as described and she was very flexible on our check-in and check-out times. As a first-time AirBnB user, I would have to say I was very satisfied with my experience.

37367	136410455	42804	113394961	Alexis	Everything good, clean and beautiful! 
37367	137800164	42811	9407116	Joni	"The location is great. It's close to both L and G subway stations and the area is full of really nice restaurants and bars. Although it's under ""a private room"", we had the whole place for ourselves for a whole week. The listing says that the apartment can accommodate three people but the couch was way too short for a grown man. Fortunately Janine let us use her bed because she wasn't around. The overall tidiness of the place wasn't top grade but all in all everything worked well."
37953	42632536	42230	41232301	Thomas	The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
37953	49055311	42277	28788560	Nour	I've stayed at Laksmi and Tanya for 12 nights and it felt like home. First, Laksmi was super convenient with the timing of check in and check out. She also answered all my questions and messages, and would genuinely give me suggestions when I needed something. The apartment is really clean as you will see Laksmi cleaning it up almost everyday. Location is great, 2 streets from Bedford avenue and  5-10 min from great cafe/restaurants/bars/metro. And the neighborhood is really safe. Laksmi and Tanya have two very friendly dogs who might bark a little loud from time to time. On overall I had a great experience living with these ladies :)
37953	50372049	42288	13277287	Ed	What Airbnb was created for!A lovely flat and friendly helpful hosts. The apartment is super well located in the heart of Williamsburg, on a quiet street but near all the life. Surrounded by great restaurants, cafes and bars and a short walk over to the waterfront.  Very well located for the Subway too, minutes walk to either the J or L lines mean that you're in Manhattan very quickly. Laksmi and Tania were delightful hosts... friendly, helpful and discrete. They made me feel completely welcome and truly shared their home. They showed me round the neighbourhood and led me to some great bars and restaurants. They were also very helpful with information about NYC and how to get around. But equally, when I wanted my own space they were very discrete. The flat itself is cosy, super clean with nicely designed furnishings. I loved it... Very highly recommended!!Thank you ladies!
37953	74455680	42505	17970745	April	Staying with Laksmi and Tania was a positive experience! Their place was warm and inviting, I loved their wall decorations. We felt right at home. They have two little dogs that were barking a bit at first, but after the second time we came in they knew who we were and was calm. They're so cute! Towels were ready for us. Everything is nice and clean. Bed is comfy! There's a nice AC unit for the room.Laksmi was nice to check up on us and was quickly responsive to anything we needed. I would definitely come back here again the next time I'm in Williamsburg! Their place was convenient, being next to Bedford Ave. All the shops and great food places was all walking distance. We had an awesome weekend.
37953	96028119	42603	32403084	Mathias	The host canceled this reservation 12 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
37953	96152617	42603	20198372	Tatiana	Laksmi and Tania were wonderful hosts. I stayed for three nights with my boyfriend at their place and we got a real Air bnb experience: staying away from home and feeling at home, not in a hotel. Williamsbourg is one of the best neighboroud for hanging out in the night and Manhattan is one stop away (by subway)  from Laksmi apt. We definitely recommend this Air bnb.
37953	105140135	42643	21068314	Merrill	Laksmi made us all feel so welcome! Me and my dogs, Noomi and Mia, were all treated like princesses! Laksmi is a doll. She's hilarious, sweet, caring, and so welcoming. She's very communicative and a wonderful host.  We became fast friends and had a really fun time staying there. It was great for the dogs because they became friends with Laksmi and Tania's dogs too. Laksmi went out of her way regularly to help with anything and everything. She kept the apartment clean, shared information regularly about everything from where to work out to laundry to fun places to go, and checked in with us all the time. The place is so lovely and the bed is super comfortable! We are officially friends now so aside from having a great place to stay in a very cool area we also made great friends! Highly recommend!
37953	107800415	42655	85357166	Elena	Clean and nice bedroom with a confortable bed. Also the toilets are clean. Safe and cool location, close to Manhattan, with lots of restaurants and bars. Laksmi and Tania are very friendly and helpful. We had such a lovely New York experience, we definitely suggest you to go!
729	21250268	41925	13357958	Jeffrey	Enjoyed our stay at AJ and Aaron's humble abode. It was very clean, tidy, spacious and comfortable. The location was perfect, it was close to the subway so it was easy access to travel anywhere. There are also bars, grocery and convenience stores close by as well. We will definitely come back again! Thank you for having us, we will see you again.
729	21845043	41937	22070274	Rao	It was a really wonderful experience living in Aaron's apartment. His wife was so nice. When we came to NYC from Florida, I just wore a T-shirt, his wife lenses me her sweater and gave us a lot of useful guidance! The apartment itself is in a very safe neighborhood and it is also very clean and tidy. It's very convenient to the subway and bus station( just two minutes walk) and takes 20 minutes to the Times Square by taking the subway! It is definitely a nice place to stay in NYC !
729	21994777	41939	4808436	Kelly	Great spacious room,,,, really tidy and convenient!!!!!! Lovely couple,,,, no stress what so ever!!!! Like we were in a real hotel.,,, simply perfect!!!!
729	24740612	42006	22171869	Heejae	The room was same with the picture. Clean and cozy. It is in 3rd floor. Also, Aj and Aaron are so nice :)
729	32031793	42136	2466180	Jonathan	Perfect experience. Nice apartment, good location and great people.  Highly recommended! 
729	32391981	42141	11109724	Dongwan	The place is spacious, clean, and even better than how the photo shows. The neighborhood is quiet, too. Aaron and aj provides everything you need to make your stay comfortable. I definitely recommend this place. 
729	33391074	42151	32468709	Jeremie	Aaron and Aj were waiting for us at our arrival. The room was spacious wing enough place for a baby bed. Some books about newyork was there and some Maps of The subway / bus lines.Our hosts were nice and give us advises in order to take The Subway or to plan free musÃ©um visit.We had pleasant talk with Aj and Aaron, and our little son play and began to learn english with them.The Subway is less than 5 minute from The appartement and newyork around 10.The neighbourhood is sage and nice with a lot of restaurants, bar, bagel store (Broadway about 10 min away).Jeremie, Sophie & Antoine 
729	33908778	42157	11705750	Marcelle	I loved to stay with Aj and Aaron.  They are extremely nice people, very friendly and helpful.  I felt as if I was staying at a friend's house.  The room is just as the pictures show and the location is great (15min to Times Square).  Very clean and silent place.  I would definitely stay there again.  
729	34457211	42163	26728937	Maja	AJ and Aaron are the best hosts one can ever wish for. They made our time in N.Y. even more amazing and we can highly recommend staying with them. It was a really nice room and a cool apartment with only 5 min walk to a street with a great variety of restaurants. Thank you so much for everything. All the best!
729	35000099	42169	16789523	Leslie	Arron and AJ are nice folks. This is a very convenient location if you need public transportation on the subway or to La Guardia.
729	35441494	42173	11495243	Takeo	It's a very pity that I could stay only 2 nights here. I've been using Airbnb several times in Astoria. No wonder this is one of the best accommodation you can imagine, very spacious , clean and extremely comfortable bed. I'd definitely come back here ! 
729	35731514	42176	35419713	Maria	We had an excellent time. Very helpful and accommodating hosts! Gave great information and directions to landmarks and events. Very nice couple, warm, inviting. Great location and easy to get to the subway. Close to Manhattan / Times Square by train. Will definitely stay with them the next time I'm in NYC.
729	41542791	42223	37839598	Yvonne	Aaron and AJ were both very welcoming and accommodating, especially seeing as I only booked a few hours before my arrival. The room is more than adequate and clean, and they have a little side table with brochures and maps which I thought was a nice touch. Wifi was great. It really is just 3 minutes from the metro stop. Unfortunately I was a little under the weather, from before my arrival and so I had to leave a day early. I didn't realise when booking (no fault of AJ and Aaron) that there was no A/C, so I found it a little tough to sleep, the first night especially, as it was very warm, but the fan provided did the best job it could. I would like to have had another eve to have a chat with AJ and Aaron as they were really lovely hosts. 
729	41662422	42224	37357292	Wendy	Although I never met my actual hosts due to tight schedules both for us and them, a friend of Aj's greeted us and showed us around the place.  She was very welcoming.  The room was spacious and comfortable, outfitted with all that we might need, including a Skittles snack!  The location was perfect for our needs and very quiet.  I would definitely stay here again!
729	44345310	42241	16929241	Savy	We were greeted by a very friendly a very helpful friend of the hosts (since the hosts weren't home at that time.) He gave us the keys to the apt, helped us navigate around the NYC subway map, and gave us a tour of the cozy apartment. The room was pristinely clean, bigger than in the pictures, with a cute welcome letter, a carafe of fresh cold water and a bag of skittles to welcome us! They even provided us with fresh towels and some soaps and lotions if we needed it. Also, the table had an array of up to date NYC tour books and foodie magazines in several different languages. The homeowners weren't home for our stay, we had the entire apartment to ourselves, and we loved it! Literally, a block from the subway station, and 1 subway stop away from the beer garden! The hosts checked in on us to make sure we were okay several times throughout the trip, and we were happy to say we didn't need for anything! Overall, a delightful experience in a beautiful comfortable apartment near to a subway stop, and gracious and sweet hosts. 
729	50630768	42290	29001409	Renee	Very comfortable and peaceful accommodations. The train is so close for commuting to the city, but not noisy at all in the apartment. We were very happy with our stay.
729	78196586	42526	39608888	Joe	Thank you Aaron and AJ for a great stay. I appreciate your assistance and help with everything!! 
729	78513856	42528	61525732	Martin & Lindsay	Aaron & AJ were an absolute pleasure to deal with and their apartment is in a great neighborhood. The room was clean and comfortable.  I wish I could've stayed longer!
729	124855648	42737	58507765	Ellis	Aj's place is really close to the subway, 10-15mins by subway into Manhattan. Aj was away whilst we stayed but her friend Alper ever so kindly came to meet us and the check in was great. Thanks for a comfortable stay!
26068	39360203	42207	5175035	Francesca And Angelique	Talie was the perfect host, she was kind, easy to communicate with and had great suggestions as to where to eat in the neighborhood. The space is enormous and very bright, and looks out on a beautiful park.It was very clean and I appreciated the minimal design. Overall it was a great experience and I'd highly recommend it! 
26068	48450729	42273	44197660	Alex	Paige was professional, easy to reach, quick to respond and very pleasant to deal with. The space itself was incredible; to have so much space downtown Manhattan!! The rooms were clean, well furnished, great natural light and had air conditioning, washer/dryer & full kitchen which was fantastic. We will DEFINITELY be staying here when we have guests in town again! 
26068	63625469	42425	182506	Kate	So thrilled with the way this trip turned out!The place was exactly as pictured, exactly what we were looking for.  They were extremely accommodating- on all fronts- and if we mentioned there was anything lacking (tea kettle, missing lightbulb) they promptly returned with the items.  Location was central for us- easy to get to where we needed.  Subway line B,D literally catty-cornered to the place.  Clean building and a great view overlooking the Sara D Roosevelt Park.  Major natural light. Definitely planning on returning!  A million thanks again...
26068	64250524	42430	1641618	Ashok	Great host.  Met me as soon as we got there, the place was nicely warmed up, right in the heart of Chinatown, the best area in NYC right now in my opinion.  Highly recommended. 
26068	66474890	42451	25165459	Linn	We are very pleased with this loft and the host Brett! The loft is huge, cool and perfectly located. Brett was quick to reply and welcomed us with beer :). We highly recommend this place and this host. 
26068	67493483	42458	24804787	Amado + Melo	Great location across the park and trains in Chinatown. Wonderful balance to experience NYC on a budget, I loved going up the 5 stories of stairs.. Host is very responsive and responsible. We had a few snags but I must say the host took good care of us!
26068	69897214	42474	59703596	Pablo	Brett,fue un verdadero anfitriÃ³n,desde el mismo dÃ­a de nuestra llegada,demorada por un inconveniente con la aerolÃ­nea,estuvo en la puerta rÃ¡pidamente,nos ayudo a subir las maletas y nos enseÃ±o el funcionamiento del loft(maravilloso,mostrado tal cual en las fotos y mas aun)no solo eso,sino que resolviÃ³ rÃ¡pidamente una situaciÃ³n con una maleta perdida,y nos hizo una lista de bares y lugares para salir,que le pedimos.El loft merece una descripciÃ³n aparte,es increÃ­ble ,decorado por el mismo,nosotros Ã©ramos los cuatro arquitectos asÃ­ que tambiÃ©n apreciamos el gusto y calidad en las piezas de diseÃ±o incorporadas a la (URL HIDDEN) vista sobre el Sara D Roosevelt Park,le agrega a este interior una apertura y perspectivas+sol por la tarde,que son difÃ­ciles de explicar en pocas palabras,inclusive,el pequeÃ±o balcÃ³n o escalera de incendios metÃ¡licas tÃ­picas de estas construcciones,permite asomarse y refrescarse por la noche,sobre todo para los fumadores ocasionales.El barrio,es lo que nosotros buscÃ¡bamos ,ya hemos venido a NY varias veces y quisimos alejarnos de la New York de los manuales turÃ­sticos para estar mas inmersos en la realidad,y este sitio es exactamente eso un punto de inflexiÃ³n,entre esa NY y el Barrio chino,profundo,de gente trabajando y viviendo,con otras caracterÃ­sticas,cultura,comida,vestimentas,lenguaje,etcetc,sobre esta linea esta implantado este loft,y aquÃ­ mismo se superponen esos locales de servicio con nuevos bares ,tiendas de diseÃ±o y lugares para comer,museos ,increÃ­blemente hermosos y hipsters,+tipicos y tambiÃ©n incluidos en los manuales com Kats Deli o FreemanÂ¨s.
26068	70850572	42481	3223332	Dror	"This loft has pluses and minuses:On the plus side, the location is amazing. Right in the middle of Chinatown, but two blocks away from the very trendy lower East side. Lots of subway lines all around. The space itself is very large and spacious, and gets amazing natural light. The host was very responsive, and very nice.On the minus side: It's a fifth floor walk up. Steep stairs. Can get tough. The kitchen is not stocked at all compared to other AirBNBs we have rented. (E.g., only one coffee cup... So take turns...) There are no closets. So for a longer stay, can get very messy. This is technically NOT a two bedroom. The second ""bedroom"" is an alcove off the living room separated by a curtain. So don't expect privacy or quiet if someone is in the living room."
26068	71951774	42490	40144210	Antonio	If you are not afraid of dozens of stairs this is the perfect place. Sunny and spacious house in the middle of Lower Wild Side. Tastefully decorated in every detail. Brett is an engaging host, discreet and efficient. Definitively our place in New York City.
26068	73785469	42500	4143865	Simon	Killer apartment and great communication with the host! Would definitely stay here again. 
26068	74801680	42506	59051209	Martijn	Toen we de foto's en de prijs van dit appartement zagen dachten we dat er iets niet in de haak was..Te mooi om waar te zijn,in het echt echter was het nog beter dan het al leek ! geen addertjes onder het gras,alles tip-top in orde,heel veel ruimte,midden in de lower east side een prachtig,ruim,licht appartement,de volgende keer dat ik we naar new york gaan wil ik weer hier logeren !! TOP !
26068	76120003	42514	10773144	Nadine	Bel endroit, trÃ¨s bien placÃ© ; ici, on se sent new-yorkais !
26068	77088538	42520	15065544	ChloÃ©	We loved our stay at this huge, light filled loft! We felt at home immediately and never wanted to leave. The space was exactly as pictured, and a perfect fit for our group. There was so much space, we almost didn't know what to do with ourselves! The art and decor was on point, and the location perfect for our LES getaway weekend. Be aware, though, that the loft is pretty sparse. It's not particularly conducive to cooking, as there are very few plates, knives, ect. We had to buy our own toilet paper, and dig around for hand towels for the bathroom. As long as your prepared for that, this place is amazing. Communication with the host was easy! We'll definitely stay again the next time we're in town.
26068	78403516	42527	3355611	Peter	Large clean, super cool space exactly as described within a couple blocks of the heart of Soho.  Great host who is highly responsive and helpful with recommendations.  
26068	79848615	42535	18370169	Audrey	"This AirBnB was A-MA-ZING! If you are looking for the real NYC experience in a NYC style loft in the best NYC location, this is the place to be!I was there for my birthday holidays with 5 of my best friends and we had the best of time! We wanted to live like proper New Yorker for a week, feel the vibe of our neighborhood, try really cool restaurants, bars and so on, and thanks to the perfect location of this loft it was so easy for us to do so!  LES, East Village, Little Italy, Nolita, Soho, West Village, Greenwich... Everything was at walking distance! And when we decided to go to Williamsburg (best up and coming neighborhood in Brooklyn!) the subway station  was just at the corner of the street!The loft in itself is huge! We had plenty of space at the entrance for our luggages (and our mess...) so that everywhere else remain tidy and pretty. A long table in the leaving room was really handy for our ""program of the day"" discussions. The mattresses in the bedrooms and the one in the living room were reaallyyy comfortable. And the appartment is filled with everything you would need!Finally our host, Patricio, was so cool welcoming, flexible, and helpful. He made our check-in and check-out extremely easy and was available for us for any request we  had during our stay!Only tiny watch out: the loft is in the 5th floor with some steady stairs. But hey...that's just the small effort needed to enjoy this place! Thank you again Patricio! We miss ""our home"" already and will definitely want to come back!"
26068	82457945	42548	59915154	Franka	We absolutely love staying at this apartment - it's bright, spacious, and wonderfully located in LES. We all fell in love with the loft style living room at first sight. The 4 of us fitted comfortably here and the beds are like soft clouds and very clean.  Our host Patricio welcomed us on the first day and I gotta say he is one of the best host I've ever met. The communication was fantastic and he made the whole process incredibly easy. He is considerate, reliable, responsive, and very helpful. One of the A/C was down on the first day we arrived but he soon delivered a brand new fan. Also he came all the way to a restaurant just to give us spare keys so 4 of us can have more flexible plans.Staying here is definitely a highlight of our vacation in New York and we would love to come back next time. :)Thanks Patricio for hosting us and all your help! 
26068	83537815	42554	49994195	Ron	A great place to stay - bright, inspiring, authentic- the host did countless things to improve our stay - met us super early so we could get to the airport, etc. The kind of flexibility and attitude that makes you want to come back, as we plan to do.
26068	85808691	42564	125138	Leah	Beautiful spot, light and airy with lots of space. such a rare gem for NYC. 
26068	97844652	42610	27775832	Marie	"I have been in NY a couple of times, but this visit was by far the most perfect one. Thanks to this wonderful, unique Loft, the perfect urban location and the best hosts one can imagine, we have had everything one could dream of. It was a very sad goodbye and a hopefully ""see you later""."
26068	99901016	42619	19814107	Peter	The space looks even better in person! This loft is such a gem and in an amazing location. The beds are super comfy! !!We went to local supermarkets in chinatown and made dinner on Sunday night. Everything was perfect. I highly recommend the space. I will definitely love to stay here again soon :)Thanks so much for hosting us ! 
26068	100484628	42622	6430181	Tadashi	Greatest place in NY
26068	102120878	42629	13967225	Joost	Nice spacious apartment in a vibrant neighbourhood. Communication by email was quick and clear. 
26068	104520584	42639	5457915	Brigitte	Super Loft, exact das NY feeling das man haben mÃ¶chte. Coole Ausstattung, sehr persÃ¶nlich, beste Vetreuung. Nachbarschaft 100% Chinesisch, was nochmal ein unverwechselbares Flair gebracht hat. Absolut empfehlenswert. 
26068	105635504	42645	26435734	Minh	The host physically checked us in and was very pleasant.  The apartment is so nice and eye catching.  It felt like we were living the New York dream staying here.  Once you get over walking up the 5 flights of stairs, you open the door and see that it was worth the trek.  If you like minimal design, this place is for you.  Makes for great photo ops.  The way it is shown in pictures is what you get.  It is really close to the BD train, pho restaurants, Chinatown in general, and across the street from a playground and basketball courts.  Be mindful of getting dressed since most of the windows have no curtains.  One of the rooms has a door, the other has a sheer curtain.  There is no TV, but I barely missed it.  Listened to music instead and enjoyed the space and the furniture.  So eclectic and funky.  
26068	107796985	42655	30117829	Tania	Everything went better than expected. The host, Patricio, is super nice and always cared about us having a good experience, he recommended us good places to eat and drink and he was always checking if we needed something. The apartment is just as the pictures and it was super clean. Definitely staying here again!
26068	108847677	42660	63014879	Jonathan	L' appartement est trÃ¨s authentique. Le vrai NY.
26068	110168956	42667	52153544	Marion	Pat has been a great host, very friendly and helpful.He has prepare a list of cool places around to go and was free to answer all our questions.The district is great , China town , just a few meters from Nolita, Soho, lower east side, all great places.The apartment is huge, and cool decoration. 2 rooms perfect with king size beds. Better to be 4 because the 5th is in the middle of the living room, but if you don't care, go for it.Really a good place, nice apartment, and the size is very rare in NYC!
26068	112547230	42680	21836412	Kate	True to the photos, this was a massive pad in a killer location. We were thrilled with our stay and would gladly book again. 
26068	120305946	42713	13037469	Pernille Boitang	This loft is huge, beautiful, light filled, authentic and with a cool art and decor. Though, it could use some tender love and care. The location next to LES is absolutely perfect. Unfortunately we had some really bad issues regarding the apartment  during our stay.Our host Patrick was in the apartment to meet us on our arrival. He told us, that the heating system was broken. Instead, there was placed 3 electric radiators in the apartment, but we could only use two at a time, otherwise all electricity in the apartment would go out. Since it's december, the apartment was icy cold. Then there was another problem, Patrick had only one set of keys, which was a big problem because we traveled 3 people together, and we should engage in different things in the city at different times. We told Patrick that, and he promised to fix extra keys and the heat next thing in the morning. After Patrick left we found out, that there were only two duvets and one thin sheet in the apartment. So one of us had to sleep with the thin sheet in the icy cold apartment. Next morning we contacted Patrick, and he promised to take care of the issues. He said he had bought a duvet, and he delivered it to us on the third day. When he was gone, we discovered that it was an old duvet with 3 large yellow stains on, and there was no cover for it. Still no extra keys and no heat.When we rented the apartment in august, we agreed with the landlord that we could leave our luggage in the apartment on departure day until 6 p.m., this was confirmed at check-in. Then on departure day we got a text that we had to drop our only key in the morning, and the landlord would come and lock our luggage out in the afternoon. Because of the lack of credibility we did'nt dare to have our luggage placed in an apartment, we no longer had the keys to. Therefore we had the stress with finding a safe place for our suitcases on our last day. We never got the extra keys or the heat to work in spite of communication with Patrick throughout the week.We had rented the apartment instead of hotel rooms as we wanted to have a place to hang out together between activities in the city. This was not an option because the apartment was so cold. 2 of us went back to Denmark with a cold due to the cold apartment. Further gave the missing keys problems for us throughout the whole week.The 3 of us travels to NYC several times a year and have always had only good experiences with airbnb apartments, therefore it is sad that this stay did not live up to our expectations at all. 
26068	121029506	42717	34376471	Quitano	If your looking for a real NYC experience them this is the place. Great location, Little Italy is within walking distance and Subway to Uptown is right outside. Hosts are awesome and very responsive. 
26068	123358271	42732	26246929	Gideon	Stayed with my family over Christmas st this great apartment. Loved it. Super location and a truly NY experience if you're looking for the slightly gritty side of NY. Slight problem for this time of year is that the apartment is not at all heated... it has 2 portable plug-in heaters, that are not really adapted for this size of place. Warmed up after a couple of days though. 
26068	125415642	42740	55631860	Janna	Very big and clean appartment near the Subway and the lower east side (great neighbourhood). Appartment is like the pictures, we would stay again. Note: it was a very!! cold appartment and just few pots and pans.
26068	127339661	42752	21154897	Jonathan	The apartment is huge. The pictures are very accurate. It is in a great location surrounded by restaurants and bars. The subway is close by and the neighborhood is very walkable. 
26068	134218075	42792	182506	Kate	This was our second time staying here and it was just what we needed, as ever. They are lovely and communicable and happy to accommodate requests. Really a pleasure. And will look forward to the next time. Thank you!!
416	83537538	42554	70853825	Patrick	Excellent
416	86716028	42568	79056858	Koray	Anna was very kind and helpful. Place was clean and safe. Recommended
416	88658744	42576	56882670	Indigo	The room is created by a divider on the left side of what is supposed to be the living room, in the pictures it appears to be a closet. Nice clean bathroom. Good place to stay for a night or two if you don't mind a slightly uncomfortable bed and no storage space for your luggage 
416	97865451	42610	5029105	Shawn	Nice little place near transit! Very clean and neat. She was very accommodating by letting us leave our bags for the afternoon while we explored the city a bit before our flight out.
416	99661208	42618	45296582	Luisa	Clean place in a nice neighborhood.
416	100129926	42620	26538428	Charlie	Ana is very sweet & welcoming.. Accommodating as well. 
416	102260302	42630	77942250	Stephanie	Ana Lia was a great host. Kept to herself but was always there if I needed anything. Convenient place to stay if you'll be taking the subway.
416	102561779	42631	9062287	Andrea	Ana was very responsive to messages. The apartment is cute, clean and conveniently located near the subway. I would recommend it!
416	104424957	42639	4167274	Marilyn	Ana was very helpful and the apartment was spotless.
416	107943172	42656	80050340	Shinsuke	Thank you so much for everything, Ana.  She is nice and caring. You cannot expect more hospitality. The apartment is in the quiet residential area and 3 or 4 minutes walk from the nearest station. Only 15 to 20 minutes to Midtown. A clean laundromat is a few minutes walk and you can find many good Italian and Greek restaurants, stylish cafes, and Bareburger near the apartment. I really enjoyed chatting with Ana. She is an amazing woman with a lot of interesting stories. I felt like home and extended my stay at her tidy apartment. When in Astoria, choose Ana's. She won't disappoint you.
416	108579701	42659	55586669	Matthew	I had a good time and she was very sweet and accommodating 
416	109879735	42666	97653240	Fabrizio	Abbiamo trovato Ana Lia dopo una brutta esperienza e la nostra vacanza Ã¨ subito decollata. Gentile, esaustiva nelle informazioni e molto disponibile. In piÃ¹ la casa Ã¨ uno specchio, a quattro fermate di metropolitana da Manhattan, in un quartiere tranquillo e pulito.Ottima soluzione per New York.
416	111274348	42673	63785568	Jorge	Nice area a little hot but comfy
416	112548082	42680	5483936	Franziska	Thanks Ana! Very good contact and clean apartment! 
416	122906336	42730	37595941	Mir	Ana is awesome!!
416	125039827	42738	67309971	Maria Del Pilar	Nos veremos pronto !!!! Me encanto la experiencia y Ana es una excelente anfitriona 
25446	58693335	42372	19185437	Alex	Audra's place was fantastic. Very comfy, around the corner from an MTA stop, walking distance to Chinatown, and a lot of good food/bars. She was also extremely nice and accommodating.The only issues I can see for some people would be the street noise in the morning, and going up three flights of stairs to reach the apartment. Was not an issue for me, though.Overall, I had a great time and would not hesitate to book again.
25446	64850221	42437	15782814	Sara	"Audra's place was fantastic!  I think this is the most ""at home"" I've felt at an Airbnb place.  Audra was extremely responsive throughout our stay.  The neighborhood has lots of affordable restaurants and hidden gems in close walking distance.  There is ample shelving and closet space, which was great too. "
25446	68398475	42464	50110012	GonÃ§alo	We really loved to stay at Audra's flat. It's surprisingly big and confortable and it's location is perfect to get to know NYC. It's a very lively mixed neighbourhood close to a lot of interesting areas (please take a look at Orchad Street). The F train (the best) is just at your door step which is amazing and easy. Audra was super available everytime we asked her anything and made us feel welcome. We definately recomend it! GonÃ§alo and Isabel (from Portugal).
25446	70141762	42476	35016097	Winston	The listing description was accurate. 
25446	71434069	42485	52774294	Fabien	Our stay in Audra's apartment was very good. It was like in the advertisement, it's really spacious for two and spotless. It's very well located, the Subway with the F train  is very near and easy to go everywhere in NYC.Before we arrive, Audra had been very available. Se answered all our questions and there were a lot! We thank her for her help. During the stay,  you can contact her if you need.To sum up, we recommand her!!!Julie and Fabien (from France)
25446	72804841	42494	33285782	Peter	Korte en hartelijke ontmoeting gehad met Audra op de afgesproken tijd en de sleutels overhandigd gekregen. Centraal gelegen appartement op de vierde verdieping in de Lower East Side of Manhattan. (5 minuten lopen naar de East River + Manhattan Bridge) Subway ingang om de de hoek. Ideaal als vertrekpunt om NY te verkennen. Relatief rustige straat vergeleken met de hectiek van NY, middenin een multi culturele wijk.
25446	74324611	42504	39839908	Laure-Amandine	Our stay in Audra's apartment was very good!!The apartment was very, sunny, roomy and clean. The subway is very near and the chinatown district full of life. Audra was a sweet and friendly host, always available for advice us.We thank her for her help and we recommand herLaure-Amandine et Pierre 
25446	75060227	42508	27109387	Yeji	It was a very clean space for my parent to take a rest after touring the city. The location was quieter than I thought it would be especially at night. Also, Audra was a sweet and friendly host! Overall, it was great space to stay.
25446	75943877	42513	47709468	Alexandra	The apartment was as listed and satisfactory for the time spent in NYC. Please be aware that this apartment is on the 4th floor with steep staircases. The apartment is conveniently close to the Metro and the handover was easy thanks to Andrew (who also helped me with my suitcase *thankyou*)Although Audra might be busy with work, she will respond in a timely manner and was always happy to help.
25446	76469637	42517	10420056	Amy	Awesome experience. Audra was super friendly getting us settled in and greeted us at the door. We knew if we needed too, we could reach out w/ no hesitation. Place was a great, central location. 
25446	81896405	42546	1467561	Alina	Good Airbnb experience. Audra was very friendly and helpful. Location of the flat is perfect for tourists in nyc. The only problem was the futon bed  because it wasnt comfortable. Audra gave us an extra topping (which was very friendly and helped a bit) but however sleeping there for 5 nights was uncomfortable.
25446	90673358	42583	12740099	Adam	Very nice location, close to the whole Lower East Side and very close to the East Broadway subway station when you want to visit other areas. Audra was easy to communicate with and her partner Andrew welcomed us when arriving to the apartment. Everything went smooth and apartment is as seen in the photos, the living room felt even bigger than the photos. If you're choosy about beds, this is not the best, but it certainly does the trick. Would definately recommend people staying here!
25446	101916112	42628	185628	Paola	"What can I say about my beautiful experience in Audra's apartment?I spent a week in this great location, the apartment is very comfortable and big, full of light and located in a very good position.Everything is as it's described in the announcement (and, maybe, better), if I have to say something ""negative"" is only the absence of air conditioning in the bedroom,but I think that if the weather weren't so hot and humid as it were in the first days of September, the conditioning in the leaving room is enough (as it were in the second part of our stay).I really loved the position (safe and interesting neighborhood and proximity to F train) and what I saw from the window, I felt very at ease and happy to stay thereUnfortunately I didn't meet Audra but she was always helpful also in giving me suggestions about some ""original"" ideas of mine!! thank you very much!!I recommend this solution without any doubt!"
25446	103509792	42635	27394097	Jenny	De omschrijving van het apartement klopte precies! Het was ruim, het was schoon, de locatie was perfect. We voelden ons echt thuis in New York. De communicatie en afspraken met Andrew verliepen erg soepel. Er was airco in het apartement, maar Audra en Andrew hadden ook nog twee ventilatoren geplaatst omdat het nog best heet was, heel fijn! 
25446	104665051	42640	25741536	Kate	Audra and Andrew were very organised and prompt with giving their contact details so that they could meet us at the apartment after our long flight from London. The apartment is perfect as a base and was exactly what we wanted. We left early in the morning and did not return until quite late at night. It's in a great location to see the city by foot, or there is a subway at the end of the road. The bed was completely fine - very comfortable with super soft sheets. There were two large fans available and an air-conditioning unit. Shower was also fine. We stayed during the weekend and it did get a little noisy outside at night - think car horns and shouting, but I guess that's part of the NYC experience! On our final day, Audra was very kind and allowed us later check-out so we had an extra few hours in the city. She text us and let us know how to check out, which was also very good. All in all - if you are looking for a base it's the perfect apartment. :) 
25446	105760857	42645	2267160	Becky	We we had a wonderful experience. Audra was quick to reply with any questions and very friendly and accommodating. The space was amazing. Plenty of room to relax. We also felt really safe in the area. The perk of being 2 minutes from the F train was amazing as well. 
25446	107849072	42655	65042665	Jasmin	Audra ist eine sehr nette, freundliche und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin. Auf Nachrichten hat sie immer innerhalb kÃ¼rzerster Zeit reagiert und war auch sehr flexibel was an- und abreise angeht.  Die Lage des Apartements ist zum erkunden von New York wirklich fantastisch. Sehr gut hat uns die direkte Anbindung an die F-linie gefallen, somit kann man direkt und super einfach auf Erkundungstour gehen. Nicht so gut gefallen hat uns das Bett (war sehr hart), ist aber auch Geschmacksache.   Das Preis -Leistungs VerhÃ¤ltniss stimmt fÃ¼r eine StÃ¤dtereise definitiv. Insgesamt also sehr zu empfehlen!  Thank you Audra !!
25446	110619768	42670	3559702	Eileen	Our stay at the apartment of Audra and Andrew was great! The apartment was exactly as the photos described. Location was also perfect, with lots of good places to eat and the F train around the corner. We were very glad to come home to a nice apartment all to ourselves after an exhausting day in the city! Audra was very helpful and responded quickly to our questions. Yes, the bed was pretty hard, but if you don't mind a hard bed this place is perfect. Highly recommended!
25446	113051478	42683	14115007	Marc	Audra was very friendly,  was very easy to arrange the arrival and check out considering our late fly. The apartment was conform to description and very close to the subway
25446	115066938	42695	8763002	Amador	Audra was a gracious host and her AirBnb is a perfect central spot to travel throughout NYC. She was extremely easy to communicate with and would endorse her AirBnb anytime! Thank you Audra!!!
25446	116334745	42703	3133362	Emily	We enjoyed a great 4 night stay at Audra's apartment. It is perfectly located to explore Manhattan, Brooklyn etc. and the LES is great for bars and restaurants. Recommend Remedy for breakfast, Cheeky Sandwiches for lunch, Beauty and Essex for dinner and Bar 169 for beers!  The apartment itself is spacious and clean - the bed is quite hard but we slept really well, so no complaints here! Andrew met us upon arrival and Audra was kind enough to let us check out late on our last day. Perfect! 
25446	120301689	42713	20950137	Thais	We haven't met Audra, Just Andrew and he was very nice to us helping with the luggages and letting us checking in early in the morning! They were very easy to communicate and she let us have a late check out as well!  The apartment is very good for a couple, nice size, heating, it had everything we needed! It is very near the F train, and we could go walking to many places in downtown manhattan! I would recommend it to my friends!! 
25446	121877783	42723	35991782	Gildas	Appartement lÃ©gÃ¨rement excentrÃ© mais proche du mÃ©tro. Bonne communication avec l'hÃ´te. 
35962	99652342	42618	89691496	Ibrahim	On arrival David welcomed us at the front of the building and escorted us to our room. The room was just as described in the listing and it was clean and comfortable. The host did a great job at making us feel like family and went out of his way to ensure our stay went smoothly. As a bonus the host accommodated us by leaving breakfast in the fridge. Would definitely stay again. 
35962	101480767	42626	94411482	Andrei	Great host!
35962	105658376	42645	34607689	Jennifer	David was very welcoming....and most of all patient with our late arrival. He waited up for us to get there, provided us with directions, and made sure we made it in safely. He even checked on us throughout our stay to see if we needed anything. 
35962	107659489	42654	94374172	Alondra	It was a good stay we enjoyed the place and the neighborhood. Easy to travel by subway. Fun visit
35962	113678812	42687	58916242	Hakim	David had great communication throughout the stay. The bedroom and apartment was clean and had a lot of privacy. I would not suggest driving there as parking is extremely limited, but the public transit is very close so it made travel very easy. There are a lot of stores in the area and it's a lively block.
35962	116697807	42706	102528302	Jonathan	The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3249	12788057	41770	11229405	Vincent	"1er voyage Ã  NYC et l'accueil est au rendez-vous. Il n'y a eu aucun problÃ¨me de communication par mail ou en direct avec Rhonda, qui est disponible Ã  tout moment mais pas intrusive. Elle est chaleureuse et nous a accueilli, ma femme, mon fils et moi, dans la joie et la bonne humeur. Son appartement, situÃ© au rez de chaussÃ©e d'une maison, est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et a le confort nÃ©cessaire que l'on attendait. Le quartier est calme et typique de ce que l'on s'imaginait au travers de nos seuls repÃ¨res que nous avions, Ã  savoir des images tÃ©lÃ©visuelles. Rhonda s'est rendue disponible pour notre dÃ©part (rÃ©veil Ã  02:45) et Ã  notre demande s'est occupÃ©e de nous rÃ©server la veille une voiture pour nous dÃ©poser Ã  JFK (30$, contre 60$ Ã  notre arrivÃ©e dans un Yellow cab). Le lÃ©ger Ã©loignement de cet appartement n'a pas Ã©tÃ© un inconvÃ©nient, cela nous a permis de dÃ©couvrir Brooklyn, cela en vaut la peine de jour comme de nuit, de prendre le mÃ©tro comme tous ceux dont c'est le quotidien, et de nous Ã©chapper de la vie trÃ©pidante et du bruit de Manhattan.Je ne regrette absolument pas mon choix et je conseillerai Ã  ceux qui veulent dÃ©couvrir NY de ne pas se cantonner Ã  Manhattan et de s'ouvrir aux districts moins ""cosy"" de rÃ©putation comme l'est Harlem ou encore le Bronx, et pour Brooklyn je conseillerai l'appartement de Rhonda."
3249	13319694	41784	12655448	Anna	"Rhonda was a most helpful and welcoming host. She was easy to get hold of and promptly answered any questions.The apartment was freshly painted, clean and tidy. There was plenty of space for our four suitcases, a wardrobe to hang clothes, tables and areas to charge our mod-cons, spread ourselves out and so on. The double bed has a firm mattress and soft, clean sheets. The windows look out onto the car porch and street but we were undisturbed. The bathroom was newly refurbished with shiny surfaces and a fantastic hot shower which we really appreciated. The dining area was where we caught up on work and watched TV. The kitchen looks out onto an old garden with tall trees. We helped ourselves to juice, muffins, toast and coffee in the mornings out of Rhonda's fridge. In the evenings, the apartment was very pleasant for chilling out without having to go out. There is a double pull-out sofa and a three-seater leather sofa as well. Our children enjoyed visiting us and there was plenty of room. It is cosy, gently-used apartment, with interesting things to look at and think about, including a collection of old and beautiful lamps.The street is quiet. There are two laundromats on the same street, sundry stores, a Chinese takeaway and a beautiful Roman Catholic church nearby. We attended mass on a Sunday and admired how beautifully Brooklyners dress for church. We said hello to the priest and attended the crowning of the statue of the Virgin Mary in the garden. We felt like part of the community - the kind that says ""Bless You"" from across the isle when someone sneezes in the pew behind you. I was very happy to attend a mass where people shouted Amen! Gospel style.The subway is a short and very pleasant walk away. We walked to and from the station along different streets just to see how everyone lived. There are a number of old, gorgeous buildings in this area. The subway for the A and C takes you to all the hip and happening places in Brooklyn, as well as to Manhattan City. We discovered several great restaurants, like the Black Swan, The Islands, Saraghina, Stonehome, Prospect, and many more in the Lafayette and Franklin areas. We were in NY to attend our daughter's graduation from NYU which is held at Yankee Stadium so this Brooklyn apartment was ideal for the airport, the stadium, Manhattan, and our children's apartment two streets away.Rhonda lives in the same building and checked in on us every day. We always had something to ask her. We felt very at home, as if we were staying with friends, and certainly by the second day we had become friends and spent a couple of evenings chatting. It was wonderful to get to know Rhonda and get a feel for the community instead of flitting in and out of places and feeling like you never actually arrived. We will be back."
3249	19331408	41892	20020018	Pietro	My wife and I have been staying at Rhonda's place for two weeks, and everthing perfectly matched airbnb's descriptions. One long review above tells everything about the neighbourhood and the place, and everything is exactly what we experienced. Moreover Rhonda was delightful, amanzigly helpful. She always replied promptly and thoroughly, before and during our stay. She is living in the same building, and is always available and kind. The house was perfectly clean and equipped with everything one could possibly imagine to need. Finally: nice place to stay in Brooklyn, great and reliable host. We recommend it!
3249	19748785	41899	5333953	Andrey	My most average airbnb experience so far 1. I wouldn't consider this as 'private apartment' since Rhonda and her daughters lives right above the place and come in and out our place any time they want without prior notice. After we started to lock our door the situation improved but they proceed visiting the place while we were out.2. There are washing and drying machines standing in the middle of the living room. But you are not allowed to use  it (unless you are ready to pay $50 penalty to Rhonda). Well, it is not a problem, but the problem is that Rhonda is using it for her own needs while you live there.3. You should be prepared to hear Rhonda's comments about the way you do things starting from microwave usage to cloths packing basing on what she saw in your apartment while you were outI understand that some of these things might be ok if you renting a room, but we rented the apartment and hoped to have some privacy.On the positive side - it is quiet there at night and the air is fresh. 
3249	20251869	41908	7191632	Barbara	Our stay at Rhonda's apartment was perfect in all ways. It is cosy, very clean and has everything you need. Rhonda was always responsive if needed, thus collecting the keys or the arrangements for our departure were very easy to made. In contrast to the previous comment we had the entire apartment at our own disposal and full privacy. The neighborhood is very nice and friendly, with a nice cafe and restaurant just around the corner. And Brooklyn is really a very good place to stay and to explore. However, the drive to Midtown Manhattan takes around 45 minutes, which is fine once a day, but does not allow you to make a short rest in the apartment and go there again.All in all, a perfect stay.
3249	20766380	41917	7920040	Kaye	We enjoyed our trip to New York.  Rhonda was a great host--very nice--easy to talk to.  Her place was as pictured---it was very clean--plenty of room for our stay.  I would certainly recommend her apartment--and stay here again myself.
3249	21300801	41926	6987259	Gretka	Rhonda welcomed us very nicely and she is very lovely and cheerful person. Flat was very nice and clean, exactly like on the pictures. Me and my friends felt very comfortable. Its only 10 mins walk to the subway and it takes you straight away to Manhatan which is awesome. totally recommned it!!!! 
3249	21543736	41931	21877392	Victor	Very comfortable house, well equipped and located on a calm town, 7-10 min walk to the Kingston subway station (line C) which takes you directly into the hearth of Manhattan. We really enjoyed our time there, and Rhonda welcomed us very warmly. She rocks!
3249	22037227	41940	17060084	Diane	Rhonda a Ã©tÃ© adorable, aux petits soins et trÃ¨s attentionnÃ©e. Elle dÃ©gage des ondes trÃ¨s positives , toujours prÃªte Ã  vouloir nous aider. C'est promis la prochaine fois que nous revenons Ã  Brooklyn c'est chez Rhonda/ the place to be /
3249	22357185	41947	20314665	Jill	My husband and I can't say enough to thank Rhonda for her graciousness as a host.  She is personable, warm, and caring, and we felt a connection from the minute she welcomed us to her home.  We appreciated the well-equipped kitchen and were able to enjoy leisurely breakfasts just like home before setting out to spend the days with family in the area.  In fact, staying with Rhonda felt like staying with family, but with just the right amount of privacy, quiet and comfort.  We also enjoyed the Halloween festivities on the block and the very friendly neighbors who greeted us on the street.  We are looking forward to staying with Rhonda again, and hope she will come to visit us some day!
3249	24868406	42007	4634440	Jean-Julien	We had a wonderful time at Rhonda's beautiful apartment. Beside the great, clean and well situated apartment, Rhonda knows perfectly how to treat her hosts. She even invited us for a traditional diner on the 1st of January. We just had a great time and I warmly recommend this bnb.
3249	31741859	42133	27783696	MaitÃª	A Rhonda foi realmente uma super host! NÃ³s chegamos com a casa super limpa, ela foi muito simpÃ¡tica e nos mostrou tudo. Ela atÃ© nos levou para a casa dela (que fica nos andares de cima) para nÃ³s assistirmos a luta com ela :D Enfim, a casa Ã© Ã³tima, tivemos nossa privacidade, no quarteirÃ£o dela existe um mercadinho onde nÃ³s fizemos as comprar para a janta. A linha C do metro fica hÃ¡ uns 10 minutos de lÃ¡, Ã© uma boa caminhada sim, mas com essa linha vocÃª consegue ir para todos os lugares mais famosos de Manhattan! Eu e meus amigos adoramos e nÃ³s agradecemos a Rhonda por ter proporcionado uma Ã³tima viagem para nÃ³s.
3249	32347500	42141	29288337	Aude	Nous avons Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s bien accueillis par Rhonda est une hÃ´te qui bichonne ses invitÃ©s, trÃ¨s disponible. Elle nous a mÃªme rÃ©servÃ© le taxi pour le retour Ã  l'aÃ©roport. L'appartement est situÃ© dans un quartier calme de Brooklyn, le mÃ©tro vers Manhattan est Ã  10 minutes Ã  pied. Il est spacieux, un peu sombre mais ce n'est pas trÃ¨s dÃ©rangeant. TrÃ¨s bonne adresse pour des personnes qui souhaitent s'Ã©loigner du brouhaha de Manhattan le soir!  
3249	33149663	42149	19214467	Slavka	House is exactly as described. Rhonda is a nice person. House is 15 min walk to nearest metro station. Apartment is on ground floor,  so you can hear everybody on stairs getting up.  Apartment was clean and newly renovated (except entrance hall)..
3249	35180083	42170	21033993	Olga	Rhonda was a great host. She deserves the name of superhost. We felt very welcome. She had bought bagels, water and cream cheese for us when we arrived which was very kind. The room was clean and it was exactly what the foto's promised to be, even the lamp in the window.We can highly recommend this place in Brooklyn when you want to visit the Big Apple. 
3249	35880498	42177	27225977	Dolores	My girlfriends and I were in a bind because the apartment we had originally reserved canceled on us 3 days before we were to arrive in New York. We did Instant Book and Rhonda's profile came up. We booked it immediately. Rhonda was a gracious host, her apartment was perfect and in a great neighborhood in which we felt safe. My girlfriends and I liked the idea of having the host in the building. Rhonda made sure that our needs were met during our stay. We recommend Rhonda's brownstone. Sincerely, Dolores , Nadine, Lynn and Lea.
3249	36394211	42183	29463433	John	Conveniently situated in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant Area, Rhonda'a airbnb is a welcome retreat from a hot (or I imagine cold) day.  Ms. Harrington had prepared for us a clean, neat, roomy apartment, complete with milk in the Fridge, fruit in the bowl, ample towels and some bagels and cream cheese for a beginning snack.  There is a very handy and easy-to-use coffee maker with lots of filters.  Grocery stores are located near-by  Several times Rhonda stopped by to chat and we very much enjoyed her visits, including her knowledge of Brooklyn and the general New York area.  This is a very choice spot for visitors who will stay from a few days to longer.
3249	38168600	42198	33342634	Stephen	Rhonda was a great host - she made sure that we had everything that we needed and kept an open line of communication with us. The description was perfect, she left fruit and bagels and the place was very clean. The rooms were very clean and the wifi was fast and never went out. The area is fairly close to a multitude of subway lines and there are many nearby dining options
3249	42984594	42232	13088676	Pascal	High Welcome LevelRhonda saved us from an initial pb with another locationShe was very helpful and did the impossible to prepare the apartment shortly for us.Gold metal for this.The apartment is perfect, private, one room, large bed, bathroom, and main dinner room with kitchen with there is a sofa.Area is quite, not so far from the subway (line A/C), Manhattan is under 20 minutes.Very clean,And the hospitality from Rhonda is very high level.We will back, Sure
3249	44550727	42243	38315613	Philippe	Le logement correspond Ã  la description et est trÃ¨s bien Ã©quipÃ©.Rhonda nous a reÃ§u merveilleusement.Elle nous a conseillÃ© et a toujours Ã©tÃ© disponible pour nous renseigner, nous guider ou tout simplement discuter avec nous. Encore un grand merci pour cet accueil si chaleureux.
3249	46134194	42255	1744828	Van Rossem	PremiÃ¨rement je voudrais remercier Rhonda pour sa gentillesse et sa disponibilitÃ©. C'est une personne chaleureuse qui s'occupe bien du bien-Ãªtre des ses locataires. Elle venait  pratiquement tous les jours  voir si nous ne manquions de rien. Le quartier est peuplÃ© de beaucoup de gens des iles, mais est trÃ¨s paisible et beaucoup de rues ont des arbres qui donnait un petit aire d'avenues. La station de mÃ©tro avec une connexion direct vers Manhattan et Time Square se trouve Ã  9 rues de la maison. Un arrÃªt de bus se trouve Ã  30 mÃ¨tres. C'est un point idÃ©al pour visiter New-York. A recommander. Rhonda nous a commandÃ© une voiture pour aller Ã  l'aÃ©roport pour un petit prix, merci :-)L'appartement est agrÃ©able, propre et on dors bien. Pour les personnes qui veulent cuisiner il y a tout, grande cuisiniÃ¨re, grand frigo. Pour les europÃ©en n'oubliez pas des adaptateurs pour les prise de courants (mais ils en vendent dans les magasins prÃ¨s de la station de mÃ©tro). Nous embrassons encore Rhonda en espÃ©rant la revoir dans le futur :-)
3249	47379568	42265	41334901	Michael	From the moment we arrived for NYFW Rhonda was the most remarkable host we've ever stayed with. The place is exactly what you expect from the photos. Very spacious, plenty of room for all your needs. The kitchen is such a nice feature, and to have a gas stove for those mornings you want to wake up and make your own breakfast is priceless.It is super convenient to get anywhere from her place. The train or taxi are minutes away. A lot of good grocers near by for any items you may need to pickup during your stay. I found a bunch of good coffee shops near by with a little walk. This place is very quiet at night with the occasional sirens like you get from any inner city.  I loved the bathroom, the inside of the place is so cozy. Rhonda made it so easy to navigate the city and was super helpful getting us our first taxi, the company we used respects her very much and had great cars. To anyone needing an affordable place that has no let downs I'd give my highest recommendation for this place. I will definitely be back.  
3249	48014907	42269	43019481	Marie Theres	Our family had a great time at Rhondas place. We were so warmly welcomed and had all we needed.Metro and Manhattan are reachable in a very reasonable time. Nice neighbourhood and good restaurants very closely. We were happy and certainly will go back to Rhonda.
3249	51938103	42302	4075753	Gwyneth	We had a spectacular time at Rhonda's place in Bedford-Stuyvesant. For most of the week, I stayed there with one guest. Then, my BF joined us for the rest of the booking. It was a little tight with three adults, but we made it work. If you're going to be sightseeing in Manhattan, Rhonda's apartment is an ideal home base. That said, during rush hour, it can take >60 mins to get back from Midtown. Also, the apartment is a >10 mins walk to either subway line. Staying at this place allowed us to explore Brooklyn as well as Manhattan. Bed-Stuy is an up-and-coming neighborhood, so it still offers good value. At night, the streets can be a *little* bit dicey. The kitchen is well supplied, so if you want to cook, you can. Rhonda is very friendly and accommodating. Staying with her is like staying with family. 
3249	58160557	42370	48369644	Noelia	Todo correcto, buena anfitriona, preocupada por nuestra estancia, barrio sin problemas, a pocos minutos parada de metro, casa limpia e identica a fotos.
3249	65042663	42439	20780943	Haim	Rhonda was great! She truly helped my parents settle in to the neighborhood in the short time they were in Brooklyn and her hospitality contributed a lot to our great time as a family. Rhonda went out of her way to accommodate our requests and was flexible, warm and overall just a wonderful host!
3249	67946271	42461	22420441	Timur	Very clean, spacious, and affordable! Rhonda is a great host. Location grows on you, but still is only 30 mins away from Manhattan. 
3249	69158788	42469	62210724	Valerie	Rhonda nous a accueilli trÃ¨s chaleureusement et nous a mis a l 'aise (URL HIDDEN) petite famille est charmante et ils nous ont bien conseillÃ© sur les choses a faire et ne pas faire.J ai eu aprÃ¨s etre partie de chez Rhonda un soucis avec une autre location via only_apartments(que je ne recommande alors pas du tout car 3 locations chez eux se sont soldÃ©es par 3 litiges) et du coup j ai appelÃ© Rhonda en catastrophe qui m a immÃ©diatement trouvÃ© quelque chose prÃ¨s de chez elle....elle est meme venue en voiture nous rÃ©cupÃ©rer mes enfants et moi car nous Ã©tions (URL HIDDEN) maison de Rhonda est trÃ¨s bien situÃ©e car proche du mÃ©tro et des commerces et meme d un supermarchÃ© et le quartier est trÃ¨s calme et le voisinage trÃ¨s sympa.....c est un quartier ou il fait bon d y vivre et en toute sÃ©curitÃ© meme en pleine nuit.Pour ma part le plus authentique et cool de New-York.
3249	69946213	42475	47907340	Valerie	"Notre hÃ´te nous a trÃ¨s bien reÃ§u , le quartier est bien desservit par les bus facilement pour aller Ã  Manhattan , par le 43 il y a une liaison mÃ©tro ligne ""L"" directe ( proche du parc Washington square) .Par le 52 on va aussi sur le rÃ©seau du mÃ©tro sinon Ã  1 km Ã  pied il y a la ligne A et C pour Manhattan . Rhonda nous a rÃ©servÃ© un taxi pour partir Ã  l'aÃ©roport  avec beaucoup de gentillesse ."
3249	73757337	42500	30723935	Matthew	It's pretty difficult to find a better host. Rhonda is very welcoming, responsive, polite, easy-going, generous. The apartment was very clean and had everything we could need, including an impressively stocked kitchen. The sofa bed is also very comfortable, which was a definite advantage as a party of more than 2. The location is nice and has easy access to two different metro lines within 10-15 minutes walk. An excellent stay all round, definitely recommended. 
3249	74624959	42506	71083427	Julien	Nous avons mon amie et moi passÃ© un agrÃ©able sÃ©jour dans cette appartement trÃ¨s fonctionnel et trÃ¨s bien situÃ© et trÃ¨s propre...Rhonda Ã  Ã©tait vraiment sympathique et vraiment gentil nous recommandons fortement cette appartement. ...
3249	95762742	42602	67039222	Emmanuel	Rhonda est un hÃ´te trÃ¨s chaleureuse et toujours accueillante. Le quartier est plutÃ´t sympathique et Ã  une demie heure de Manhattan.
3249	96611829	42605	87745730	Octavia	This was a great place to study I loved it here! It was so clean and quiet Rhonda was so polite she accommodated me in every way . I recommend staying here any time!
3249	100471709	42622	4505325	Ramona	Rhondas was a perfect host. She was were welcoming (she bought fresh bagels for us when we arrived) and she was so helpful (she arranged a cheap taxi to the aiprort for us). The apartment was super clean, enough space for three people. All in all it was very lovely to stay at her place. There are only two points we thougt were a bit problematic:since it's an apartment in the basement and the slepping room is towards it is very noisy all the time. And, especially at night, the area didn't seem very safe. Taking bus at night or walking the 20-30 min from the subway is very tough and takes a long time e.g. from Manhattan. You should take a taxi if you stay there!Then you will have a great time in Rhonda's house and with her as host. She was lovely!!
3249	102051474	42629	55132118	Crystal	Our trip was an absolutely amazing experience for our entire family which was truly enhanced by our experience (EMAIL HIDDEN)munication prior to our arrival was great and we were met by warm greetings upon arrival and each encounter we had with Rhonda (and her family).  The apartment is spotless, well stocked and comfortable.  It is the perfect  size for our family of 3.  It is conveniently located within a couple blocks from bus lines, or a brief walk to the subway within 5-10 minutes.  There is also a readily available Uber via curbside.  We quickly and easily headed to Manhattan each day to sightsee, as well spent a day in Brooklyn all with ease.We had great little stores to stop in throughout our days and also delicious restaurants just down the street, Peaches Hot House is a MUST!We have already recommended Rhonda's house to family and friends who have mentioned traveling to NYC/Brooklyn.  It was simply beyond what we had expected for a place to rest each night.  We would brew coffee in the am, sit out on the steps and chat with neighbors passing by like we truly lived there.  We honesty felt like part of the family after our 7 day stay.  Rhonda had us stocked with coffee, bottled waters and bagels upon arrival.  She worked with us for checking in and checking out with ease, even allowing us to leave our bags to sightsee  a bit before our late departure.Hopefully I've raved enough to make anyone stay here and we look forward to our next trip to NYC as Rhonda's place will be our first stop:)  Thank you!!
3249	103455705	42635	18941703	Sameera	My mother and I arrived a little earlier than expected at Rhonda's and so she was still cleaning when we arrived. She helped bring all of our luggage in from the taxi and made us feel extremely welcome immediately. We were given a tour of the place and Rhonda told us about everything we would possibly need to know for our trip. The kitchen was well stocked with the basics and the place was extremely clean and well maintained. It was close (15 mins) to 2 subway stations which take you straight to Upper and Lower Manhattan so very easily accessible. The location is also close to some cool bars, restaurants and many supermarkets should you need to buy food or drink.Rhonda was always a message, call or knock on the door away to answer any of our questions or concerns. My mother and Rhonda developed a friendship during our stay which was absolutely wonderful.Rhonda was the best host anyone could ever ask for. I'd definitely recommend staying here and would absolutely stay here again! 
3249	105139900	42643	1222010	Martin	My wife and I are from Europe and it was our first time in NY. At first we were not sure about Brooklyn. Is it safe enough? Isn't it too far to do all the sightseeing? Turned out it is a perfect location where everyone knows each other within walking distance (10-15 min) to two metro stations, with a very friendly and welcoming host (thank you Rhonda for making us feel so good). The apartment was very well stocked and cleaned, Rhonda even let our friends from Slovakia have a sleepover, which was very kind of her. Also, what we appreciated the most - there are very good coffee places just around the corner - Sincerely, Tommy, which is also a clothes designer shop, Kettle coffee, very Instagram friendly and a fantastic bagle place Nagle's bagels. Don't think New York is just Manhatten, you'll be missing out. We would be sorry if we haven't spent at least three days in Brooklyn!
3249	107175642	42652	59692569	Clara	Fue todo barbaro! Rhonda es muy amable, cariÃ±osa y nos hizo sentir muy bien. El departamento es muy cÃ³modo, tiene todas las comodidades y sÃºper limpio. La prÃ³xima estadÃ­a en ny volveremos! Lo recomiendo!!!!
3249	110170566	42667	3699521	Rebecca	Rhonda's apartment was perfect for us. It is very well equipped comfortable and spotlessly clean. I usually don't sleep too well when I'm traveling so I was delighted with the comfortable bed and the quiet street. The Location was superb for us; within walking distance of the subway and express trains into Manhattan. We ate in terrific neighborhood restaurants every evening and the nearby grocery store had everything you could need. The very best part of our stay was meeting and being cared for by Rhonda. She has to be a rock star in the Airbnb host world:patient  and helpful, readily available, but mindful of our privacy. She provided bagels cream cheese and bottled water to get us started and checked in with us from time to time to make sure all was well. She even rescued us after we left our cell phone charger behind by bringing it to us and giving us a ride to the subway. She is really a gem and we would stay with her again in a heartbeat.  Five stars for Rhonda!!!
3249	110964159	42672	8962741	Ben	Rhonda is by far the best airbnb host I've ever had the pleasure to meet. Her house is spectacular and the level of care she provides to her guests is unmatched. After our first rental wasn't up to scratch, Rhonda saved us. Her place is very homey and inviting and the location is fantastic. The ammenities are great, the beds are really comfortable and her house is very clean. She is also very inviting and very easy to talk to. Stay here and you won't be disappointed. As I said, the best place I've stayed in years. Thank you Rhonda!
3249	112542890	42680	49850002	Alen	Rhonda e' stata eccezionale e l'apppartamento super! Fin da subito Rhonda ci ha dato consigli utili dall'aeroporto al suo appartamento, l'appartamento corrisponde esattamente alle foto pubblicate. Lei vive al piano superiore con la sua famiglia ed per tutto il soggiorno ci ha sempre lasciato la nostra privacy. Per ogni esigenza si e' dimostrata premurosa e gentile. Il quartiere e' molto carino con ristoranti/caffe' per ottime colazioni e brunch. Un po' distante dalla subway ma ne vale la pena fare due passi e soprire Bedford-Stuyvesant. Se dovessi ritornare a Brooklyn sicuramente sceglierei di ritornare da Rhonda per ospitalita', gentilezza e pulizia. Appartamento consigliatissimo!Alen
3249	115705809	42700	19712222	Tiwat	Rhonda is a great host and we had a great time talking to her. She helps us to make our way around Brooklyn and Manhattan. 
3249	121232563	42719	9602764	Calvin	"I was expecting an apartment in an apartment building but this is a room in a private home or as Rhonda calls it ""family house."" Both doors of the apartment like room open up on to an entry way that is shared with Rhonda and her family. According to Airbnb this is still considered    an ""entire home"" but in my opinion it is a room in a home. Although the room does contain everything an apartment would. I think the listing should specify the fact that this is not an apartment in an apartment building but an apartment like room in Rhonda's home (a room that does not include a private entrance but forces the guest to walk through the entry way of Rhonda's home. "
3249	122885980	42730	102802138	Jucong	This is my first time use Airbnb, Rhonda is a excellent host, I said I will be a bit late on the date of checkin, but actually I arrived earlier than I expected, she ran back and gave me the key as soon as she can, this is very impressive. On the day of the Christmas Eve, she came by and said merry Christmas to all of us. Highly recommend to use house here.
3249	124698227	42737	53998617	Lu	The place is great, about 10-15 mins walk to two subway stations which will get you to almost anywhere. It is very clean and quiet, and facilities are good. Rhonda is very nice and gave us a warm welcome. We definitely enjoyed our stay!
15189	83838977	42555	72393850	Zina	Even though Deep was not there, he was a great host and did everything possible to make our stay pleasant; he was easy to communicate with, accommodating, and even provided additional toiletries. His roommate was there, but she was very friendly, sweet and very laid back. They both provided great suggestions for places to go, even though I am a native New Yorker. The location of the apartment was very convenient for me and surrounded by great restaurants, bars, sites and neighborhoods. Almost everything is walking distance, and the train is minutes away. The apartment and the room itself was very clean and airy, which was exactly what I was looking for. I highly recommend staying here if you want a truly great experience staying in the city! 
15189	87220870	42570	24705224	Martha	The location is amazing!! Its between Brooklyn (2 trains stops away) and not far from Time Square. The location had so many restaurants and small shops I love East Village and would be the place to stay. The building is secure and you feel secure.  Overall its a nice place to stay and its clean and Deep is fast responding back!
15189	90833706	42584	37626316	Zayden	Deep accommdated everything for us before we arrive with easy communcation. We weren't in the apartment during the day except came back to sleep so didn't have much conversation with his roomates. Room looks recently remodeled and moderen. Location is moderate walkâ??wise and excellent with bus and subways. Walkable to a famuous brunch and a ramen place of NYC, this is best becuae you can go in the morning to avoid long wait. Will consider here first when I come back to NYC for round 2.
15189	94382810	42597	83032792	Kirin	Thoroughly enjoyed my stay in New York! Even though Deep wasn't there himself, me and my travel partner had no issues finding the place, having access to our keys and generally having a great experience. He was always super prompt with his responses and even told us a couple of places to visit in the neighborhood while we were there. East Village has such a great vibe and it was really lovely being in the centre of it all! 
15189	125001860	42738	79329449	Roberto	Nice place to be very central lots of restaurants and barsI recommend you .
15189	129688203	42767	14747647	Matias	This apartment was perfectly situated in East Village. Room was nice and quiet. Apartment was very clean at all times which is a great plus when you're only renting a room. Deep was very friendly and easy going! Would definitely recommend to anyone.
15189	131106973	42776	47346011	Daniel	Stay here is  an excellent option for visiting NYC
15189	135858241	42800	5410826	Lauren	Deep was quick to respond to any message and to my initial reservation request which was very short notice.  I'd note that this is a pretty functional type listing, it gets the job done given that it's one bedroom in a three bedroom unit . Very clean though! 5 min walk to the nearest subway station and all around a central location. 
34338	75020945	42508	17088378	Bora	Nathan and his home is amazing!!! His place is conveniently located right next to Columbia University and very close to the subway. Nathan's beyond considerate and made sure our stay was comfortable and pleasant. He even provided ear plugs because...well it's NYC! I would love to stay here again and I highly recommend this place!!
34338	75833764	42513	18922307	Pamela	Great place! Nathan was such a great host even coordinated with me to allow me to leave my bags earlier in the day and the bed is so soft it feels like a hug! Will definitely stay here again
34338	77953914	42525	2577802	Bradford	Nathan was a great host overall and this was a great place to stay in Morningside Heights! The description on AirB&B was very accurate and matched what I expected with the home. It was great having my own room and then the living room as well with the doors if I needed a little more space. Plus, very nice to have an AC unit in the room! Iâ??m not bothered by street noise at all, but he even had earplugs in the room. Basically, had everything I was looking for â?? clean and tidy room, wifi, my own set of keys for easy entry, and a great host. Definitely recommend staying with Nathan!
34338	80060102	42536	1516398	Vignesh	Nathan was a great host. Very quiet, coordinated getting the keys, and respectful of the space. As a host, I'd rate him 5.One thing to note is that the space is a bit smaller than it looks and the bathroom is quite small as well. The house is probably a 3 or a 4. Other than that, it was a good stay .
34338	93855631	42596	71147083	Madison	Absolutely perfect. Nathan made me feel right at home. Great space and close to the subway, supermakets, and bars. I could jog in Central Park or Riverside. Very clean and had all the amenities I needed. We became great friends and I would definitely come back again! 
13019	1140674	41015	279150	Kaushik	Fabien is a great host and provides total flexibility, trust and privacy. The room and bathroom was clean (new construction in NYC). I strongly recommend his place.The location is very good and convenient to get to downtown (6 train stop was a block away).
13019	1223574	41032	1372445	Vladimir	These were our first three days in Manhattan and we spent them in a great appartments of Fabien and Shannon. They are awsome hosts - helpful, kind and very tidy. The apt is really clean, even my neatnik girl was satisfied. It's easy to find and nice located - there are some fine restaurants in arounds and just a few blocks from Central Park and Subway Station (line 6).So I strongly recommend you these apartments.
13019	1250480	41037	2249397	Julie	My fiance and I stayed with Fabien for a weekend while we house-hunted in NYC. The apartment is a block away from a 6-train stop in a great, secure building. The neighborhood has several good restaurants, bodegas, and a little bakery on 102nd & Lex for coffee and delicious home-made breads.  The apartment itself was pristine and the room we used was private and had a comfortable full/queen bed. We're quite familiar with NYC so Fabien pretty much left us to our own devices, which was perfect for us! 
13019	1452761	41070	318034	Matt	Great place and even better host. You can't do better.
13019	1524565	41080	2484724	Chris	Fabien and Shannon were wonderful hosts- friendly, helpful, generous.   Their apartment was also ideal-- it is clean, bright, fairly spacious for NYC, and only 1 block from the subway!
13019	1575678	41087	2440922	Arina	I had a good stay at Fabien's apartment. The apartment is very nice and clean. I had no chance to meet Fabien cause he was out of town.The apartment is close to the subway station. I really enjoyed my 4 days there.
13019	1668405	41099	109113	Stephen	We loved staying with Fabien. His place is very neat and clean.  Being NYC, it's cozy! Awesome shower. Close to the metro. 
13019	1783977	41113	128444	Emanuele	Fabien was a great host. Very accommodating with  our  unusual check in time. The apartment was perfect. Very close to the subway . I would stay here again. 
13019	2005389	41137	1737577	Logan	Fabien and Shannon's place was an ultra-chic and extremely comfortable apartment in a great location and a great neighborhood. Their apartment is a hop, skip, and a jump away from the 6 train, which makes it super easy and convenient to get around the city, it couldn't get any better. Also by their place is a great hole in the wall bakery and cafe which has really cheap baked goods and the owners are really sweet- a great way to start the day. Overall, my stay was great and I couldn't have asked for better hosts. Fabien and Shannon were extremely welcoming and so nice! I wholeheartedly recommend! 
13019	2471104	41183	222404	Gidon	I stayed in the apartment for a week. The room was quite and clean, just like in the photos and the apartment is very well maintained. The bed is super comfortable. Awesome location. Fabien and Shannon were amazing hosts, very nice and friendly. I felt very much at home in the apartment and I would love to stay there again! It was a perfect vacation!
13019	2722215	41208	3536528	Kit	Ficamos nove dias no apartamento de Fabien e Shannon. Trata-se de um imÃ³vel muito bem conservado, limpo, equipado e de fÃ¡cil acesso: exatamente como aparece nas fotos e na descriÃ§Ã£o. O quarto que eles alugam Ã© pequeno, mas muito adequado para um casal. Ambos sÃ£o muito acessÃ­veis: nos deram muitas dicas e nos fizeram sentir muito Ã  vontade. SÃ£o tambÃ©m muito discretos e silenciosos: praticamente nem notÃ¡vamos quando estavam em casa. Os arredores do apartamento contÃªm tudo o que Ã© preciso: estaÃ§Ã£o de metrÃ´, ponto de Ã´nibus, delis, restaurantes, farmÃ¡cia e mercados. Altamente recomendado!
13019	7708270	41547	3822798	GÃ©rald	"NEW YORK est rÃ©ellement ""amazing"", il y a trop Ã  faire et Ã  dire pour le synthÃ©tiser ici, vivez-le tout simplement!!!Fabien et Shannon sont aussi gentils que discrets, leur chambre est idÃ©ale pour un couple souhaitant dÃ©couvrir New-York dans un quartier, qui plus est, tranquille loin du tumulte du Lower Manhattan.Cette quiÃ©tude permet de dÃ©compresser aprÃ¨s les kilomÃ¨tres de marche effectuÃ©s dans la journÃ©e!!!"
13019	56140421	42347	34677305	Hannah	Loved the location of the apartment, just 5 minute walk and you're surrounded by the stunning Central Park. Fabien was a good host and great on communication which made us fee very reassured. 
13019	57897567	42368	46450284	Mireille	DÃ©s le premier contact par mail ou sms, on s'est senti accueilli par notre hÃ´te, avec des rÃ©ponses claires Ã  nos questions et des mots chaleureux. L'appartement est vraiment trÃ¨s proche de Central Park, d'une bouche de mÃ©tro et de lignes de bus principales qui mÃ¨nent rapidement Ã  Manhattan, donc c'est le plaisir d'Ãªtre dans un quartier calme, bÃ©nÃ©ficiant de la proximitÃ© d'un coin de nature avec ses Ã©cureuils et ses arbres et celle de la ville trÃ©pidante, ainsi qu'un Harlem pas trÃ¨s loin oÃ¹ l'on peut bÃ©nÃ©ficier des cultes Gospel! Un rÃ©gal dans la diversitÃ©! Le chat de Fabien nous attendait chaque soir ronronnant et se laissant cajoler, un peu ...comme Ã  la maison, ce qui rendait le sÃ©jour encore plus agrÃ©able pour mes adolescents!Literies parfaites, de bonne qualitÃ© et de tout pour se faire un bon repas si on voulait. Appartement trÃ¨s propre.Fabien nous a laissÃ© une liste de tout ce qu'on peut faire Ã  NY, mille recommandations pratiques surtout Ã  notre arrivÃ©e, s'est mÃªme renseignÃ© suite Ã  une de mes questions sur les spectacles potentiels et Ã©tait toujours disponible par mail ou sms, bref notre ange-gardien. Que du bonheur!
13019	58340771	42371	41484509	Johnny	It was a great experience staying in Alexis' apartment. The location is great with the metro and central park nearby. Apartment is cozy and classy. My friends and I found the kitchen area particularly charming because we could cook and had a relaxing brunch together. Their cat, Mr. Deeds, is definitely nothing but cute. We really enjoy his affectionate company. If you're traveling with your family or good friends, this is the best place to stay like a home.
13019	68514871	42465	24615100	Koren	Fabien and his friend is friendly. The apartment is located at the discreet street, it is quiet at night let us had a good sleep, the location is nearby the Central Park and the subway, neighborhood have some nice cafe and restaurant.  When we first night arrive, Fabien and his friends out for vacation but his friend give us a door key which is convenient and let us check in easily. Although we never met owner Fabien but he was really helpful during our stay, he gave us some nice coupon and suggest us some nice place to hangout and eat. It's is really helpful for whose are visit the city.  He has a cute cat in the house as well, if you like pet, you will going to like him. 
13019	80870300	42541	67004093	John	Fabien was the perfect host! Everything was made very easy, and we were provided with all the information we needed. The apartment itself was the perfect location, close to the subway, clean and very comfortable with a nice balcony area. We had a great stay and were very glad we chose this apartment. 
13019	88472497	42575	31624513	Jennifer	We wanted to love our stay...  But the resident cat along with the reasons listed below made that impossible.  #1:  We were told there would be clean bed linens.  Instead, we discovered cat hair was thoroughly dispersed in the pillows, sheets, comforter and blanket in the larger bedroom.  We had to resort to using a lint roller to remove as much of the hair as possible.  In the smaller bedroom, while there was significantly less cat hair, there appeared to be some sort of lint-like debris stuck to the sheets that made it feel like there were food crumbs scattered on the sheets.  We value our cleanliness and nothing is worse than feeling dirty while you try to sleep.  #2:  The cat loves to wake everyone up with non-stop meowing in the wee hours of the morning.  It did not shut up.  Note that we slept with our doors shut due to issue #1 from above, which probably contributed to the meowing.  But still...  #3:  We came in the middle of July in 80-90 degree weather.  Although the AC is great while it's on, it has an auto shut-off feature that we couldn't change.  So each morning we woke up hot and sweaty and one of us would have to go and reset the temp on the thermostat.  #4:  The air circulation / ventilation in the smaller bedroom is terrible.  The air would be hot and stale very quickly.  And the AC's auto shutoff feature didn't help with this problem.#5:  The cat jumps all over the furniture and onto the kitchen counters.  ***Side note (given all the negative cat-related feedback):  We are not cat haters.  We have a cat ourselves.  And we do not have any of the cat-related issues identified in this review.***#6:  Given the hot weather mentioned above, note that the entry foyer and elevator reeked of garbage.  #7:  Although not listed as an amenity, we found it odd that an iron / ironing board is not provided.
13019	93960529	42596	85476020	Juan C	El lugar es fantÃ¡stico.  El edificio es renovado comparado con el resto de los edificios de la calle.  Hay lugar para estacionar el coche al menos en 2 o 3 calles aledaÃ±as, bastante cercano de una estaciÃ³n del metro y con tiendas abiertas hasta las 2 de la maÃ±ana.Fabien fue muy amable y respondiÃ³ todas mis dudas, e incluso me dioÃ³ tips para buscar estacionamiento, ir a lugares y cositas sobre el departamento propiamente.Por dentro, hay clima, la cocina bien equipada, dos camas cÃ³modas.  El baÃ±o.Si ustedes no son amantes de los gatos, o alÃ©rgicos a ellos, quizÃ¡s haya que contactar al dueÃ±o para saber si el gato estÃ¡ o no en el departamento durante su estancia.  Fuera de eso, le doy un 100.
13019	107962401	42656	95307764	Sara	Despite being out of the country, Fabien was easy to reach and provided clear instructions for acquiring the keys and letting ourselves in. The apartment was just as pictured, tidy and comfortable. There were even soft drinks and a bottle of wine for us in the fridge. Fabien provided a welcome packet in advance that included notes on the neighborhood, local attractions and restaurant suggestions. It felt like our home away from home and we hope to stay here again in the future!
13019	109598233	42665	92739981	Leslie	Great area for local restaurants - Thai, Italian and more . Local deli and supermarket nearby. The 103rd St subway 2 min walk for 4/5/6 train . Apartment great with everything you need. The resident cat ,Mr Deeds , is a friendly wee thing and good company. Fabien was in contact at all points to answer questions. Good instructions for keys etc. A great stay and I would book again and recommend.
13019	123762124	42734	32277545	NadÃ¨ge & Nicolas	Appartement trÃ¨s agrÃ©able Ã  vivre et idÃ©alement situÃ© pour accÃ¨s Ã  central park et Down town en mÃ©tro ligne 4/5/6. De plus le quartier est vivant et bien achalandÃ©.  Nous le recommandons 
16246	83678228	42554	4345800	Jardine	The space is really simple and beautiful, spartan, organized, and easy to move into. The bed had been perfectly made, and the towels puts out. Stephen was very responsive, and I love the neighborhood. I used to live in Brooklyn but didn't know this part of it, and loved exploring. Definitely recommend!
16246	99683463	42618	90696598	Christian	Great apartment in a convenient location; has everything you need. Stephen was very accommodating and friendly. Would highly recommend. 
38064	67919877	42461	8478931	Jack	Nice location, easy-going/helpful roommates, it was a nice stay!  Thanks, M!
38064	68547162	42465	17901788	Reinhard Kleist	Small room, but everything I needed. Great neighborhood. Close to trains to Manhattan.I loved the people there and I even saw a show there on my last night. The place is a true Williamsburg experience. Very arty indeed.And I became best friend with their dog, Sam.
38064	70435837	42477	28367248	Gareth	I was warmly welcomed by everyone and really appreciated chatting about the local and my plans before each day began.
29561	75536911	42512	5943820	Tendekai	Hannah was a great host. We had a good conversation on arrival. Her place is awesome as well. Very spacious and well looked after. The bed was comfortable, high ceilings and you get a good dose of sunlight. It's also very conveniently located to the train and some nice spots. I definitely enjoyed my stay and would stay here again with no hesitation
29561	89890354	42581	84129254	Vanessa	Hannah was a great host! She was really nice and was available to answer any questions. I enjoyed my stay at her place and would highly recommend her place. The AC was on and my bed was comfy. 0 complaints :) 
39240	104000	40445	210020	Ian	Anastasia was a pleasure to deal with.  Always prompt to reply to questions prior to my arrival and very helpful.Apartment is in a very convenient location, only a 2 minute walk from the subway and in part of Williamsburg that still retains an older, multi-cultural, character as it hasn't yet been gentrified and overrun by hipsters but is still only an easy 10 or so minute walk from the cooler areas like Bedford and Metropolitan Avenues.
39240	110855	40454	213797	Jody & Willow	Anastasia's place was the perfect Brooklyn crash pad for me.. she was extremely accommodating on short notice, her place is very clean and the shower is amazing! Would highly recommend her place to anyone;)Jody
39240	123147	40471	220129	Will	Anastasia was absolutely wonderful and helpful with restaurant tips and advice.Her place was clean and very convenient as it was only 2 minutes from the subway station and easy to get to Manhattan when needed. The place also has an amazing shower! : ) 
39240	138231	40495	277646	Lance	Comfortable studio, clean linens, and in a great location -- one block to the subway and across the bridge to Manhattan. Plus Anastasia knows a lot about the area and she was happy to give tips for places to eat or hang out. Recommended!
39240	140482	40498	280986	David	Anastasia's studio was very clean, comfy, and convenient. It's a 2 minute or so walk to the subway from there, and maybe a 10 minute walk to the heart of Williamsburg, which is a happening area with lots of cool shops and restaurants. The studio was actually pretty roomy for me and my two suitcases, and is decorated in a cool way. Anastasia was super-nice, too. I happened to be looking for an apartment during my stay, and she was very helpful in giving me some leads of places to look. Naturally, she was also able to recommend some good spots near the studio.The only negative thing I'd say about this place are that the futon you sleep on is not the most comfortable. Probably not something that important unless you're an old person or something, though.
39240	167466	40550	319505	Britne	Anastasia's place was charming! The perfect artsy, zen getaway that I was looking for. The place was quaint and located 5 minutes away from the JMZ and very close to various stores and not too far from restaurants and the like. Anastasia was a lovely host and answered any questions that I had and was very accommodating. I would definitely stay at her place again. 
39240	247153	40664	525871	Jasmine And Theresa	Anastasia's studio was a perfect spot for us -- one block from the JMZ lines, and two blocks from the G, a few minutes' walk into the heart of Williamsburg hipsterdom and a quick train into Manhattan. Also, sleeping amidst the milliner's creations helps attune a person to the surreal beauty of the city.  
39240	249247	40665	50062	Theresa	Anastasia's place was super convenient with lots of metro stops nearby. The place is small but totally great for two people, the bed/couch is comfy and it's fun to be in a milner's studio. Anastasia always responded to us promptly and was very helpful. We highly recommend her apartment. 
39240	333794	40719	669785	Molly	Your host is a very friendly woman and the place a great place to crash for a couple of nights. Not the best place to hang out in since it is rather small, but located in really nice blocks, so why stay inside anyway? Clean and personal, but remember it can take some time to get air in that air-bed if you need to use something more then the sofa :)
39240	357225	40730	196929	JÃ³n	Me and my friend stayed with Anastasia for a week and had a fantastic time. Apartment was all we needed; nice and clean, close to the subway and walking distance to lots of cool places in Williamsburg. Anastasia herself is amazing - energetic, outgoing and lots of fun. If you're looking for a good time in NYC, look no further!
39240	409023	40755	401155	Jim	Anastasia's studio was perfect for my two week stay in the city. It wasjust big enough to have some room to stretch out, but small enough to not feel overwhelmed. Very clean place that was very very convenient to where i was working in the city. If you need any help finding anything in the area or in the city really, she's the person to ask.If work or play ever brings me back up to NY, i will definitely contact her again. My stay was great.
39240	581150	40815	674132	Anoushka	Anastasia was the perfect host & did everything possible to please us guests. The Studio is nice & full of interesting props. Very well situated!Would always stay there again!
39240	598058	40820	1124939	Alex	We enjoyed our stay at Anastasia's charming studio. Our first impression was that it was larger than the photos suggested. Perfect for a couple. The fold out bed was comfortable. The location was fantastic for getting around Manhattan and exploring Brooklyn by subway. Anastasia was very helpful and prompt at replying. We had a great stay and recommend this place. Thank-you so much Anastasia! 
39240	636679	40833	878379	Ryan	Really liked Anastasia's place.  The location was great, very close to a subway (1 block really) and close to two- or three deli's that were open late night.  Awesome for getting a roast beef sandwich late after a LONG day.  The place was clean and well setup.  Everything we needed was left for us.  Liked the art too!  Choose Anastasia's place? Why? Because we felt safe, secure and close to everything.   Transit ride to times sq was 30 mins, door to door.  Not bad right?!  10 minute walk to Bedford in the heart of Williamsburg.
39240	717212	40861	1226765	Maria	We stayed at Anastasia's 10 days. We found everything as expected, according to the description and pictures provided; everything was clean and neat, it was very easy to check in and out and she even contacted us on the first day to give us some tips of where to go eat and such. The apartment is in Brooklyn, 2 minutes away from the closest subway station and only 2 stops away from Manhattan. Comfortable and recommendable stay!
39240	824276	40910	1444484	Aine	We had a wonderful time at Anastasia's great apartment. It is clean secure and central. We will return as soon as possible to visit again. We recommend Anastasia to all potential visitors!
39240	1355658	41056	1885458	Josephine	Nous avons passe une agrÃ©able sÃ©jour dans l'appartement d'Anastasia. Le quartier est calme et assez pratique ( resto, deli, et supermarchÃ© proches). Le mÃ©tro M et J est a 1 rue. Le mÃ©tro G est a 5-10 min a pied. Lâ??appartement est parfait pour un couple qui visite NYC et la dÃ©co vaut vraiment le dÃ©tour. 
39240	1848861	41121	2179739	Eva	Anastasia's place is small but great. Clean, good location, awesome shower, but a bit lacking in terms of cooking/eating space. 
39240	2530977	41189	3242358	Mikolaj	Anastasia's place is awesome! We stayed for two weeks at her place, and we had a wonderful time, one of the best vacations we ever had. It's a very nice, clean apartment in the most exciting area of the city. It's very close to subway stations, which are literally 5-10 minutes (1-2 stops) away from Manhattan (taking the J, Z and M trains), or 15 minutes from downtown Brooklyn (taking the G train). Also, despite the central location in Williamsburg, it's a surprisingly quiet place, even for a ground floor apartment. It's an absolute must to check out some local places in the neighbourhood, especially the ones right around the corner, and Anastasia was very helpful with recommendations and any info. 
39240	2583722	41193	3716276	Francesco	We stayed in two for five days and we found this apartment very nice. It is very close to the metro station which is a couple of stops far from Manhattan. Anastasia was very accommodating and gave us lots of advices to enjoy our stay. Recommended! 
39240	2631386	41198	3407660	Jeremy	Anastasia's studio is pretty cozy (read: small) and a little loud, but that's about what I expected from a S. Williamsburg studio 1 block away from the J/M elevated tracks. It's perfectly located, lots of great cafes, restaurants and shopping in the area, and it's 2 stops away from Manhattan, if you like that sort of thing. No complaints, everything was just great, best wishes to AA.
39240	3277170	41279	4145982	Sarah	My daughter and I stayed in Anastasia's lovely comfy studio for several days over New Year. It was super-warm, cosy and decorated with pics of her amazing work (check out the Grace Jones ones). It's actually more spacious than it looks on the photographs. Massive bonus is that it's a two minute walk from the Hewes subway station that takes you straight into Manhattan in less than ten minutes. It's also reasonably close to Williamsburg's hipster neighbourhood if you're into that kind of thing (ie Bedford ave and surrounds, for ace cafes, vintage stores, restaurants and bars). And don't miss the 24 hr deli on the corner of Hooper and Broadway - delish gourmet sandwiches. Will be back for sure (and I'm going to commission a one-of-a-kind hat! - examples of which you'll find in the studio).
39240	3650218	41332	4964109	Mel	Anastasia's hat studio is a lovely place to stay. PROSThe apartment is memorable and full of interesting things to admire. It's pleasantly cozy, warm, clean. The location is good. Within blocks of a great neighborhood with hot drinking/food options. Having the J and M subway line just a block away means you get good transit options and convenience without having to hear the train all the time. The host is straightforward, professional, and conscientious - she thought of everything, and everything ran smoothly. CONSThe apartment is on the first floor: a bus line runs on the street, the building's trash cans are kept outside the apartment's only windows, and there's some kind of auto shop across the street, so there was quite a bit of street-level noise. You're out of luck for natural light or breeze. Bring earplugs and get out of the apartment if you want some sunshine, and you'll be fine. IN SUMThis is a lovely place to stay in a fun neighborhood, under the care of a quality host. If you are enchanted, as I was, by the charm of a milliner's studio as shown in her photos, you won't be disappointed. 
39240	3873118	41356	5194483	Tim	Anastasia's South williamsburg apartment was very nice. It has all the conveniences you will need, a nice kitchen, a clean bathroom and a cozy living/bedroom. The apartment is full of fun and artistic objects, which gives a nice homie feel to it and there is alot to see.It is really close to several subway lines, such as the L,G,J,Z and M trains hat will get you in downtown manhattan within two stops.In the nearby area there are lots of trendy bars and 24 hours grocery stores.Anastasia is a real nice host, who knows her way around in New York as a native Newyorker. Her airbnb profile also includes nice things and places to go in the nearby area.The total experience was really good and i would recommend her place for a pleasant stay in New York!
39240	4492549	41402	5544256	Corinne	We spent seven days in the studio Anastasia.For those who want to visit New York is very well located: easy access to metro (without the noise ...), Williamsburg Bridge not far (for those who like to walk ...)Brooklyn is really a neighborhood to explore.A small reserve on the bed lacked a bit of comfort ... That said after a day of walking we are still asleep!
39240	4757737	41418	5551705	Rob	The apartment is the workspace of Anastasia. She makes hats. It is nice and clean. A litte kitchen with cooker and refrigarator, a bath with a very nice shower. And we could use her computer and wifi. The bed is a good sleep-bank with nice clean sheets and blankets. The subway is super close next to the grocery stores. The contact with Anastasia was good. She replied quickly to all our questions. The only minus was that while we where there, there was a construction site next to the building. They woke us up early during the week. 
39240	7951240	41556	994835	Rebecca	Anastasia was communicative and helpful, with a super late check in and super early check out, she was flexible with our arrangements. Always providing the latest goings on around NYC to us, we felt we were in the loop. The apartment is more than serviceable, and although a bit loud, it's big and so close to the subway without being on the line. The guidebook and bars around the area were great and by the end of our stay we felt Williamsburg was coolest suburb to be in! It's such an easy walk to Williamsburg cafÃ© strip.
39240	8093551	41562	8846375	Nicola	Very very good position if you want to stay away from Manhattan but still super close to it (literally 2 subway stops). The place is interesting in its own...which was a pleasant surprise. Anastasia was super helpful, kind, and flexible to accomodate out time schedule. I will highly recommend it!
39240	8430645	41577	5403640	Merisa	Anastasia is an excellent host who was very helpful and informative. She even was kind enough to check us in at 2am due to our late flight in. The  apartment was perfect for our stay. Close to a ton of cool restaurants , bars and shops. Close to public transport. Would definitely stay again!  
39240	8602086	41585	9486904	Jeremy	Anastasia and her studio were both wonderful. The studio is in a convenient location for access to both the hustling streets of Williamsburg and the trains to Manhattan. Anastasia puts care into setting up the room for guests - you can feel it in air, the feng shui feels so good. This isn't a posh Manhattan loft or a dingy room on the far edge of town; it's a room at the perfect balance between those two, with loads of character and a bit of tranquility.
39240	8870790	41601	5529194	Bram	Very good value for money, great location. Excellent location,a stone's throw away from several metrolines. Williamsburg itself is definetely exploring too. Unique appartment, filled with all kinds of fabulous hand-made hats. Anastasia's friend who gave us the key and showed us around was very friendly and attentive. The flat is large, has everything you need (kitchen, bathroom with tub and PC with internet, internet is a bit on the slow side though). Bed is a convertible sofa, but is comfortable. 
39240	8945913	41605	2351435	Amber	Anastasia's flat was a perfect little interlude for me, as I was coming home from travel and had airbnb guests of my own for one day after my arrival back to NYC. Anastasia and I are friends for many years, now, and I fully support her with her beautiful, convenient space, right across the street from my own apartment. It's so wonderful that we have these situations to help support each other. Her place was clean and tidy, spacious and had everything I could have needed. I was a happy camper, for sure!
39240	9165896	41618	7040473	Heidi	Anastasia is lovely and we had a great time at her place. It was clean and conveniently located close to the subway line and excellent restaurants. Anastasia was attentive and on-time in all of our communications. It was great to be able to use her desktop computer when we were doing our research on which exhibitions to see and the best routes to get there - many thanks for that. And, she had it tuned to a great online music source which we listened to in the evening before bed. We would definitely stay at Anastasia's again. 
39240	9284061	41626	9888185	Sven	"We had a great stay for 5 nights in Anastasia's Williamsburg studio.  The location is basically perfect - it's only moments from the subway so it's very quick to get into Manhattan, but there are loads of great bars and restaurants on the doorstep.  Anastasia's online ""guidebook"" to the area was really useful and we tried out lots of her recommendations.  Dinner at Moto (1 block away), brunch at Le Barricou, a bar crawl along Grand St and pottering around Bedford Ave were all highlights :)  The apartment is pretty funky and we loved living there.  Very useful to be able to use Anastasia's computer for researching and booking things before heading out for the day.  The bed is a futon, but fairly comfortable. Bathroom has a decent shower with good pressure. The building next door was being renovated when we were there, so a little noisy first thing in the morning, - I'd recommend some earplugs...  All in all, an excellent trip."
39240	9392589	41634	6059023	Tony	This is a really unique place to stay in Brooklyn. Great location: convenient to metro and market. Awesome restaurants and pubs within walking distance. Anastasia is a fantastic host! Prompt communication. Overall fantastic. 
39240	9588029	41642	887750	Angel	The Place: Great location, steps away from the subway with all the amenities one would need near the the apartment in an eclectic neighborhood.  The apartment itself is comfortable, charming, and reflects the personality of the host.  The Host: Overall, Anastasia is a generous and thoughtful host.  Communication with Anastasia was prompt and effective.  She made sure my mother and I were comfortable in her apartment by offering her air mattress and her computer, as well as advice for things to do in the neighborhood.All in all, a good place to use as a platform for your NYC vacation!
39240	10041543	41666	11045658	Wanda	We had a great experience with Anastasia and using Airbnb for the first time. Anastasia is a gracious host and was flexible when our travel arrangements got changed due to the weather. She stayed in communication with us during the whole process. 
39240	11620220	41738	11625299	Clara	The studio Anastasia was exactly what we needed! the locations is perfect, there are a lot of things to do in Williamsburg! Anastasia is a perfect host. She always replied quickly to our questions, she gave us a lot of advises and nice restaurants/bars. She always wanted to be sure that we are fine during our stay. For our next trip to New-York , we will definitely come back to anastasia's place!  Thanks Anastasia!
39240	12062728	41751	12772709	William	This place was perfect for me! It was conveniently located really close to the subway, it was clean, and the shower had good pressure. There was everything I needed in the kitchen to make what I needed to eat. Also I really liked that I didn't need to be super quiet at night, I was able to listen to music whenever I felt like it. Anastasia provided an amazing guidebook with lots of really great things to check out close by, and although I couldn't make it she even invited me out to a party one night which I really appreciated! This was my first experience with air B&B and I would definitely use it again.
39240	12194526	41754	14416077	Jessica	Great spot and clean studio. My friend and I booked a last minute trip to Brooklyn and Anastasia was really helpful and thoughtful. I recommend this place. 
39240	12405050	41760	6175060	Dmitry	Anastasia is a great host, made us feel very welcome in NYC. Her guide to Williamsburg is very helpful, all the places are definitely worth checking out if you want to see true NYC scene and lifestyle. The flat is cute, has a nice little kitchen and a comfy sofa bed. And a real nice shower! The floor's a bit cold, but, apart from that, everything is great. We loved it and would stay there again!
39240	12971452	41775	11826187	Louise	"Anastasia's apartment is in a great location & is really close to the subway. The apartment is located a little way from the ""hip"" part of Williamsburg which was good as it was quiet street. Still lots of cool bars, cafÃ©s & places to eat within walking distance though. The studio is small but Anastasia has decorated it eclectically & every day I found something new on the wall that I hadn't noticed before. Also the shower is fantastic. We really enjoyed staying there & Anastasia was very kind & checked up on us to make sure we were having a good stay."
39240	13343862	41785	2174514	Indira	"Anastasia's apartment is a piece of art! I really enjoyed staying there. It's not only beautiful and creative, but also very clean and comfortable. And there is everything you need everyday: sheets and towels, shower stuff, hairdryer, computer, WiFi and all essential tableware. Anastasia was very helpful and nice! Thank you for everything!Actually, the location was not perfect. I really liked Williamsburg, but the apartment is located 15-20 minutes from ""hip places"". The nearest streets from the apartment are not so nice. It's not a problem, just be ready to that) A good thing is that it's very close to subway (not more than 3 minutes), but the line works really bad at weekends.And one more disadvantage - the apartment is located on a ground floor right above trash bins. And there is a car repair across the street. So it was very noisy and I had to sleep in earplugs although I usually sleep very well in any noise) However I really liked the apartment and would love to stay there again)"
39240	13958372	41799	1819331	Eoin	We had a great stay in Anastasia's studio. She was so helpful right from the time of booking (every advance detail was covered) until the end of our stay (very kindly let us store our bags & meet us to see us off). Not only is the studio full of character but the neighbourhood is also buzzing day & night and really diverse. Access to 3 subway lines just around the corner & 15mins walk from the main hub of action at Bedford avenue. Loads of great cafÃ©s, restaurants & bars all around so you won't be stuck for choice! Anastasia also has a cool little guide of her fav local picks. Apt has all you'd need for a stay including a desktop PC, fast wifi, sofa bed with memory foam mattress, great shower etc. would defo stay again.
39240	14302639	41806	3607493	Charles	I had a very enjoyable stay here. The studio has a good location close to the subway in Brooklyn. Anastasia was a generous and friendly host, and communication was very easy. The studio has plenty of character and can only recommend to others!
39240	14520509	41811	13657984	John	We had a wonderful stay at Anastasia's studio, it's very close to an underground stop but also walkable to the bars of Williamsburg. She provides a really handy guide of places to go in the area and sorted out any questions or issues we had very quickly. Can't recommend enough!
39240	14739222	41815	3752489	Chad	Anastasia was a great host! She checked us in and offered some great info about the neighborhood (be sure to check out her guide book). The place was clean and had everything we needed. The bed was a little small (a futon) but was comfortable enough. 
39240	15101931	41822	15590067	Josie	This is a great ground floor studio in a great location - only a short walk to the heart of Williamsburg and plenty of shops and bars nearby. Trains to Manhattan 2 minutes away. The futon is very comfortable with the extra foam pad and the studio is clean, well stocked and a very interesting and original place to stay. Anastasia is very flexible and helpful, allowing me to check in and out at times that suited me. The only slight problem was noise at night as this is a ground floor apartment, but this wasn't a big problem, and really, if you've come to New York expecting silence, you've come to the wrong place.
39240	15458178	41829	669794	Mahira	Anastasia was a great host. Her studio was comfortable and charming. She was helpful and accommodating, The place was clean, close to the subway and a real little gem in the heart of Williamsburg. If you like bohemian funky chic style as I do, and want a cozy, clean, nice place that's not in Manhattan, but close to it, this is for you. She even had a computer with internet access for our use. I stayed here an extra night because I felt so much at home here. 
39240	15870956	41837	4914644	Liisa	Anastasia was a great host. Apartment was nice and so special, we liked it a lot! 
39240	16270635	41844	17934214	Stephanie	Anastasia is an awesome host, she received us very nicely, she gave a lot of advices, her guidebook is very useful. Her place is just amazing, very well located. My boyfriend and I loved just our stay! Thanks for everything!
39240	16473000	41848	12002827	Jon	Excellent stay in Williamsburg. This apartment is in a great location to explore Manhattan and Brooklyn,  and also within 15-20 minute walk of a load of great bars,  cafes and restaurants. Anastasia was a great host,  meeting us on arrival and giving us a good rundown on the local area,  and also letting us leave our luggage in the apartment until 5pm on checkout day. Would highly recommend.  Good value for money in New York.
39240	17341167	41862	13121659	Vanessa	Tout Ã©tait parfait L appart comme sur les photos Propre et accueillantAnastasia cool pas de prise de tete flexible sur les horaires d arriver et de dÃ©part c est trÃ¨s apprÃ©ciable Parfaitement situÃ© pour visiter NY 
39240	17678223	41867	15966085	Madhu	Anastasia's place was fantastic - clean, conveniently located and good dÃ©cor. I highly recommend this as a terrific value for money and great place to stay.
39240	18041964	41871	3062365	Claudia	Anastasia was out of town when my boyfriend and I stayed at her place but she asked us to get in contact with her assistant. The place was lovely and tidy, with a very quirky decor. We loved the motivational quotes all over the walls! The apartment was quite noisy as it is right on the street level so we kept the blinds closed throughout but I think that is all part of its charm. We made up the sofa bed ourselves but it was pretty comfortable. The subways station is a three minute walk and provides excellent links to the City. 
39240	18795895	41883	3790534	Lorenzo G.	Anastasia's house is a really nice place, and particularly well located. Is located just two minutes from the metro station to Manhattan. The area around the house is attractive and livable. The house is clean, cozy and comfortable. There is everything you need. Anastasia was out of town and unfortunately we could not meet her in person but we have been in contact during our stay. We met her assistant Eduardo who is a really nice and helpful person. We spent a wonderful week in New York! The check in and check out were flexible! We absolutely recommend it! Thanks Anastasia
39240	19084426	41888	3266702	Ula	The space was very clean and welcoming. We felt very comfortable and it was the perfect size for us. The neighbourhood was great and we were very close to many amenities, attractions and very close to the subway. We had a great time and we recommend the space highly. 
39240	19597983	41897	17550778	Katrin	Die Gastgeberin hat fÃ¼r uns alles sehr gut vorbereitet, Ankunft und SchlÃ¼sselÃ¼bergabe ging ohne Probleme,es war sehr sauber und genauso wie beschrieben. Es lagen genaue Tips fÃ¼r die direkte Umgebung und ReisefÃ¼hrer bereit. Im Haus selbst war es ruhig, nur die StraÃ?e und das Treiben dort waren manchmal etwas lauter. Es hat uns gut gefallen, Anastasia ist eine Gastgeberin, die man weiterempfehlen kann,Williamsburg hat uns SpaÃ? gemacht...
39240	20230026	41908	17612343	Marie	Anastasia was a great host and her studio perfect for our trip to NYC. The apartment was clean, conveniently located near the metro and perfect for our trip to NYC. Even though we had to re-schedule several times due to pilot strikes, Anastasia helped us out and coordinated our arrival. It was great to have such a reliable host who responded within minutes! Thank you :)
39240	20989517	41921	7972206	Lorant	Cute cozy and tidy studio. The place is easily accessible to the JZM lines- although you need to walk an extra stop to Marcy on weekends, and has plenty around it within a short walking distance. The bed couch thing was very comfortable and the use of a computer with internet as well as wifi was a bonus. It was clean and had most of what you needed. I would recommend for the solo traveller. Anastasia was overseas while I was there but still managed to respond to a question which was great and her assistant was also friendly and there to meet me quite early which was nice. In terms of the noise well yes the garage opposite was quite lively and the window doesn't block anything out. It was more the lively chatter (yelling) of the guys that work there that was the noisy part rather than mechanical noises. The bathroom was good and a great shower.
39240	21945198	41939	5328129	Catherine	Anastasia was helpful and communicative. The studio was spacious, comfortable, and private. The location worked well, close to subway and a reasonable  walk to the heart of Willamsburg on the other side of the highway. On the ground floor, it can be a little noisy at night and earplugs helped considerably. This was an easy place to spend a week and enjoy a home away from home.   
39240	22203257	41944	1114146	Kate	Never met Anastasia, but she was very communicative over email and she had her assistant meet us with keys.  The place is nice and clean, but bring your own soaps and shampoos.  It is on the street level so it is quite noisy, so I'd recommend bringing some ear plugs.  The bed is very comfortable, except one spot where it folds there is a divot. Overall a nice experience!
39240	22427614	41949	20877479	Daniel	Our stay at Anastasia's Williamsburg located apartment was really pleasant. The apartment was clean and the neighborhood was quiet and you felt safe while walking home during late hours. 24 hour open grocery stores just around the corner from the apartment and walking distance to Williamburg's cosy and hip areas. Great contact with our host that made us feel very welcome. 
39240	22763644	41957	6837059	Mariano	Muy buenos 7 dÃ­as pasÃ© en el departamento de Anastasia, que estÃ¡ en una ubicaciÃ³n ideal para aquellos que quieran vivir un ny diferente. No obstante estas a escasos diez minutos de la gran manzana.Eduardo su asistente siempre atento y dispuesto a ayudar y colaborar. Excelente experiencia 
39240	23023092	41963	23715825	Alex	Anastasia's apartment was perfect for my stay. The studio is nice and the futon is comfortable once you add the foam top. The location is good - it does get slightly noisy at times from street traffic, but that's normal for NYC. Her hats are wonderful too! 
39240	23456142	41974	7487057	Jim	"Comfy, cozy and cool space!  We really enjoyed staying in Anastasia's apartment / work space.  Being surrounded by her beautiful hats and other artwork was a great experience.  The apartment is in a super convenient and safe location, with easy street parking.The apartment was very clean and well appointed.  The bed is a fold-down sofa with a memory foam mattress that is very comfy, and my 5'10"" GF and 6'2"" Self slept just fine for four nights.Anastasia was great in helping us out with everything we needed.Highly recomend  the place and will stay there again!!"
39240	23745636	41982	15086428	Avery	This was our first experience with airbnb and I cannot express enough in words our gratitude for Anastasia. We were navigating through the city in the pouring rain, she was helpful from the time we got off the plane to the time we left. She met us there with the keys to the apt, and had all kinds of suggestions for things to do/where to eat both in the neighborhood and Manhattan and exactly how to get there .  The place is great, clean, cool, spacious and easy to get to and from Manhattan on the train. I would definitely recommend as it was like having a friend in a foreign city. After a cold and rainy weekend with lots of hurdles she even helped us get to a spa in the area which truly came as such an appreciated gift of relaxation when we needed it. Would definitely come again!  
39240	25162125	42012	2315631	David	Great apartment at super location in Williamsburg. Somewhat noisy, but that is part of the experience living in a vibrant neighbourhood. It was a bliss getting the keys and Anastasia was really helpful and welcoming. Recommendable place to stay in NYC!
39240	28190879	42082	26027934	Rachel	Anastasia was absolutely amazing and accommodating, especially since we booked in such short notice. Her place was spacious and pristine in terms of cleanliness! She was warm and welcoming to us and extremely easy going when she greeted us upon arrival! Would definitely stay at Anastasia's place in the near future. And we can't thank her enough for her hospitality!  
39240	29415941	42101	10323494	David	Anastasia's place is a gem and I couldn't recommend it more. Probably the best value I've come across on Airbnb. Clean, interesting and located in an ideal part of Brooklyn. The whole experience was a seamless one. We'll be back!
39240	29978132	42109	26858034	Celine	Anastasia is a charming hostess.  The apartment was comfortable and clean. This is an artist's studio, Anastasia creates hats, perfect to plunge into the atmosphere of the neighborhood! It is located in the south of Williamsburg in a residential area which was quiet. I enjoyed my stay at Anastasia !!!
39240	31041002	42125	4945780	ZoÃ«	Anastasia's studio is a great base to start exploring from. Very conveniently located near the subway and there are many bars and little restaurants just a stroll away. Make sure to try the local Brooklyn beer! And there's live music every night in a lovely bar called Moto next to the subway station.The neighbourhood feels very safe and lively and there's a great supermarket at the top of the street. The apartment is clean, though a tad dark, but there are tons of lovely details that make it feel very homely. Those details and the designer hats that are on display make it a unique place to stay. And very important: the shower is fantastic!
39240	31780488	42134	25425091	Ally	Anastasia was a great host, we couldn't have asked for anyone better! Our flight was delayed by an hour so we ended up at the apartment pretty late, but even so Anastasia couldn't have been more welcoming. She had lots of recommendations of places to go for dinner and drinks, and even got a map up on the computer to show us. Anastasia also sent a message a couple of days into our stay just to check in with us and make sure everything was ok which was really nice. The space itself is great! So arty, and a lot of floor space. The sofa bed was really comfortable too. The kitchen had everything we needed and more, as did the bathroom- fantastic shower! We loved how accessible the apartment was too, so easy to get to. We would definitely recommend staying here, there is not one thing I could fault in any way. Thanks so much! 
39240	33506156	42153	5699884	Katie	Anastasia's house is in a great area near transport links with some cool bars and places to eat. She was easy to contact and very hospitable. The place was clean and has great style. We had a brilliant time in NY - thanks Anastasia!
39240	35295840	42172	25679989	Henri	This apartment is well located right next to the subway and a walking distance from Williamsburg hipster main streets. Anastasia always replied quickly to messages and gave us a super energetic and positive welcome. We stayed for 11 nights.The space itself was inspiring with the hats and photos. We also enjoyed the numerous motivational quotes on the walls.The bed was comfortable and large enough for two. Noise from the street is well audible inside. Sensitive sleepers such as myself will find earplugs useful.The kitchen was useful for breakfast etc. and the water filter made water taste great. The air conditioning was not currently installed but available upon request. The computer and especially the speakers were a great bonus. Being able to play music made us feel right at home!During our stay we encountered quite a lot of ants in the kitchen and bathroom, as well as two large bugs running around the main room floor on one night. This is not uncommon in NYC.Overall this place was great value, highly recommended in the area.
39240	36682698	42185	18816295	Fred	A really nice stay in Williamsburg! Amazing host and really well located. Easy to park as well if you come by car. I totally recommend. :)
39240	37323754	42191	22491815	Leaura	Anastasia was a great host! The guidebook was definitely a handy reference for exploring south Williamsburg; it's how we came upon a few of our favourite spots during our stay. The neighbourhood was colourful with a ton of character, a bit off the beaten path but a short walk away from coffee, brunch, bars and transit. It was a fantastic environment for two ladies on a 4th of July weekend getaway, the hats were also a nice accoutrement ;)The flexible check-in and out times were immensely helpful, too! When we arrived, Anastasia was already waiting for us outside ready to usher us right on in. All in all a wonderful experience!
39240	38205532	42198	11985634	Tyler	Great stay in Anastasia's apartment! She was very easy to communicate with on everything leading up to the stay and walked me through the rest once I got there. The apartment itself is really cool and has everything you would need really. It's very close to the subway, but also an easy walk to great surrounding neighborhoods. I would definitely stay again! 
39240	39003363	42205	22614415	Jenny	Anastasia was a great host! We felt at home and the apartment is located in a great neighbourhood. Thanx for everything'
39240	40740246	42218	34163039	JÃ©rÃ©mie	Great flat, perfect spot and cool host! Anastasia is very flexible and there are only 2 train stops to go to Manhattan. We spent an awesome 10-day stay in the Big City.
39240	42550816	42230	17575265	Natalie	Our experience was fabulous.  Anastasia was very flexible and checked in by email frequently to see how we were doing.  The apartment was beautiful and clean, and the neighbourhood was amazing.  We were a block from the subway and surrounded by great restaurants and cafes.  We ate very well.  I would recommend this place to anyone.  
39240	44301921	42241	3145489	Leopold + Christiana	The host canceled this reservation 6 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
39240	44777096	42245	32105513	Christopher	Appartement trÃ¨s bien situÃ© , trÃ¨s proche du mÃ©tro (10min de mÃ©tro pour manhattan) , quartier sÃ»re .Mais assez bruyant  . 
39240	49103837	42278	17622597	Luz	We very much enjoyed staying at Anastasia's place.  She met us up to give us the keys and gave us a walk through of the apartment.  The apartment is very tidy, comfortable, and everything we needed. Great location, close to two train stops.  Plenty of bars, shops, and restaurants in walking distance.  We would totally stay here again. 
39240	55930175	42345	27182452	Graham	Anastasia was a great host, and her place is really easy. If you're used to living in a busy city, this place is perfect -- close to everything and well provisioned.
39240	56532452	42352	3842346	Kanan	Anastasia was a great host! The place was great and perfect for what I needed. Very warm and cozy even though it was cold outside. The place was nicely decorated and extremely clean and inviting. The area was very walkable. Anastasia provided a great list of places to visit which was extremely helpful for my first visit to New York. If you're looking for a great place to stay in Brooklyn near great places to go out and be close to Manhattan this is the place to you. I would definitely book here again!
39240	57316335	42362	1419784	Gianni	Anastasia's place was a nice place to stay. The apartment is clean and feels spacious with the high ceilings. I liked the neighborhood, there are good cafes and restaurants very close. The train is right there and you can be in LES in minutes, or you can walk to other parts of Williamsburg. Check in and out was a breeze, Anastasia did a great job getting me the keys. I had a good stay. 
39240	60233492	42389	18412010	Saruhan	Great location. Great space. Weird in all the right ways. Patient, understanding host. 
39240	62381594	42414	52870386	Natali	The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
39240	78802792	42530	27531582	Koji	The host was the best as can be in my opinion, as she communicated with me thoroughly before, during and after my trip. Additionally, she provided a great list of places to checkout around the area, I absolutely recommend pies-n-thighs. The location was great and VERY easy to go to manhattan, (literally a block and half away from the Hewes St. stop) and a walkable distance to any part of Williamsburg. The noise from the street did not bother us because of the white noise machine and the AC did a great job. It wasn't the biggest place in the world, but it was a great single bedroom type apartment studio with privacy. We booked on pretty short notice, and Anastasia replied with upmost swiftness. Compared to other airbnb's, this is a jewel, especially if you are not keen on the idea of sharing a home with someone you don't know.
39240	80233085	42538	12251	Pat	Anastasia's place is colourful, clean, comfortable, and close to the subway stop. She was welcoming and helpful, and the neighbourhood has plenty of food options nearby should you not want to walk deeper into Williamsburg (towards the river) or jump on a train to Manhattan. Be prepared for some noise from the street, but there is a white-noise machine kindly provided to help keep disturbances to a minimum. I had a great stay, thanks Anastasia!
39240	87115754	42569	8932407	Vlad	Anastasia is a great host. Though we never had a chance to meet, we were provided with the keys and checked in with no problems. The apartment is just a couple of minutes away from two subway stations but we used to go on foot a lot and ride a bike to Manhattan, Bushwhick and everywhere. The laundromat, grocery stores, pharmacy and everything you need is nearby. The apartment is small but still big enough for two. Thereâ??s kitchen with all utensils available for home cooking. No bathtub but great shower. We stayed in NY in July when itâ??s really hot outside, so the air conditioner was nice to have. The apartment is 40 minutes away from JFK. Everything was great, there was nothing to complain.
39240	101734486	42628	70940511	AmÃ©lie	Appartement bien situÃ© proche du mÃ©tro et dans un quartier sÃ©curisÃ©. Anastasia a Ã©tÃ© Ã  notre Ã©coute tout au long de notre sÃ©jour mÃªme si nous l'avons pas vu.
39240	108985670	42661	43495545	Oren	Our stay at Anastasia's place was excellent!Even though we didn't meet Anastasia during Check-in, it went smooth and easy. We had good communication throughout our stay as she wanted to make sure everything is OK with us, and was generous at check-out, which was relatively late.The apartment was clean and comfortable (great shower!!). The area has a lot to offer and is pretty convenient transport-wise. 
39240	110482295	42669	47617503	Christiane	Anastasia's studio is perfect for a couple who wants to explore NYC and Brooklyn. Very close to the subway and just a few stops to Manhattan. Also a lot of bars, restaurants and other facilities within walking distance. Anastasia is quick to reply to messages, and helpful with additional inquiries. A great hostess!
39240	112891026	42682	45903511	Erin	Our stay at Anastasia's was fantastic. It was clean, convenient, and comfortable. The apartment had everything we needed for a few days in New York. Though it is in Brooklyn, the M and J train are around the corner so getting into Manhattan was easy. Anastasia provided a great list of recommendations for both Brooklyn and New York City in general. 
39240	113961143	42688	96181331	Numan	My wife and I really enjoyed our stay at Anastasia's studio apartment! She was super nice and accommodating and the studio was as described. Great location near lots of bars and restaurants and very convenient to the subway station. Would highly recommend! 
39240	117016992	42708	102551234	Wilfred	Hi Anastasia, Your place is really cool. Location is fantastic and really easy to commute especially the M line. I enjoyed the Pandora music as well as WiFi. Good for conducting Business as well as going around doing the typical touristy site seeing. Thank you for you help  & directions! Cheers
39240	120443627	42714	98075946	Millie	Anastasia's place was wonderful! It is conveniently located near the subway and pretty easy to get into Manhattan. The neighborhood isn't particularly quiet, but we didn't mind just something to be aware of especially if you're a light sleeper. I would definitely come back to Anastasia's place!
39240	121143786	42718	27618321	Eliot	The apartment in Williamsburg is beautiful. It meets all expectations. It is one block from the subway and three blocks from restaurants and bars. The bed is very comfortable, city noises are at a minimum despite 1st floor. Clean bathroom and accessible kitchen. Fast wifi and a great packet of all info you would ever need. We plan to stay here, if possible, from now on when we visit nyc! Host is extremely responsive and helpful for anything you need. Flexible and relaxed hosts. 
39240	122280783	42726	40332884	Hannah	I had flight delays that caused me to check in late at night; Anastasia was helpful and communicative throughout the process. I loved the location and the apartment itself. There is wisdom to be gained from her decor. Lots of good food, bars, and shopping close by and a short train ride to Manhattan.
39240	124707918	42737	84433082	Jenni	Right in the heart of Williamsburg! Cozy with a cool feel. Could walk pretty much anywhere. Was very accommodating to me checking in late! 
25624	47400118	42265	22008246	Nicola	Ingrid Ã¨ stata molto gentile e mi ha accolto con molta disponibilitÃ . La camera Ã¨ molto accogliente, ma il quartiere di notte Ã¨ molto rumoroso. In sintesi: consigliato se si vuole risparmiare
25624	49149553	42278	12392012	Patrick	Ingrid is the perfect host, the place is clean, roomy & bed comfortable and the host is easy and responsive. I will definitely do it again! The key exchange was a breeze even with the rain.
25624	55604905	42341	41661472	Jose	Ingrid is a very nice host and was very helpful. She was very efficient in fulfilling our needs. The flat is located in a lively area, close to metro, shops, cafÃ©s, etc.
37130	136869456	42806	119649995	NoÃ©mie	SÃ©jour parfait, chambre trÃ¨s propre, colocs vraiment trÃ¨s sympas !! Je recommande !!
37130	137082847	42807	6504468	Greg	The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1554	53579562	42317	8647034	Karen	Luis and Gladys are wonderful hosts.  They are new to airbnb.  They  just converted their basement area to a studio apartment.  There isa private entrance.  The whole area is well appointed.  The main bedis a queen and the other, a double.  The couch changes to a doublebed in a unique way - more comfortable than a hide-a-bed.  Thebathroom has a shower with hand held rain type shower head.  They had many self care items available-hand soap, body wash andshampoo,etc.  The kitchen has a microwave and large toaster ovenas well as the regular stove.  The refrigerator is a full size one.  There is a place to hang clothes and lots of the fabric drawers for otherclothes. 
1554	55263842	42337	28172884	Maria	It has been an overall great experience. The studio is super clean, comfy and has absolutely anything one would need. It is in a very safe residential location that is close to transportation. I cant say enough about how an awesome host Luis was. He was very accommodating, very helpful, welcoming and made sure I was comfortable and I had access to anything I needed. I definitely recommend it to any couple of small family and I would definitely come back!
1554	57052772	42359	49583136	Severo & Arlene	Luis and Gladys were great Hosts, very friendly, attentive and always available to answer our questions. The Basement studio was beautiful, spacious and very clean and exactly as shown in their photos. The neighborhood was great and safe, close to trains and buses and walking distance to restaurants and shops.
1554	59060288	42375	37550858	Ana	"The reasons why you SHOULD stay in this place :- it is in New York City- the flat has everything in terms of furniture and kitchen tools and well decorated - safe areaThe reasons why you SOULD NOT stay in this place:- it is very noisy, the family has no respect for the ""guests""-they don't help at all. the first day we were going to their place, we had to call them more than six times and leave voice message for them to come pick us up, which he said he would, but he kind of didn't care and didn't answer our phone calls. We had 4 luggages and he knew that. -when we left the ""flat"", since we were 3 (when leaving, we were only two at the beginning) we had 7 luggages and we asked him if he could drop us in penn station because of the subways and all the stairs. We offered to pay. He say no having the excuse that he was going to work. When we left he was still at home at 10am.-the wi-fi totally sucks! -we had a day without hot water. We sent a message through airbnb but they didnt say anything, I had to go knock on their door.-the flat is SUUUUER hot, even during the winter, and to make it even better, the air conditioner  (ac) didn't work the last day. -the first night starting at 7 am we heard a call ringing non stop, vibrating all day long. (we made sure it wasnt ours!)-the third night I dont know if it was a screwdriver or a vacum cleaner, that we started listening at 1 am and the next day at 3 am.-the last day, at 3 am they started arguing with each other. Either it was husband and wife or wife with kids or the father with the kids. Almost everyday we heard someone arguing really loud. Screaming as hell. Like they had no guests.  -the poor dog, I dont know if they were stepping on the dog but he would yelp several times specially in the morning.This was written and agreed by all three people who were in the flat."
1554	59522570	42380	17742846	Ellen	Luis was a friendly host and was extremely accommodating.  He let us check in early, which was extremely helpful so we didn't have to worry about our baggage.  Unfortunately, Luis was sick and we never really got to know him.   The basement studio was clean and cared for.  The bed was very comfortable.     It had everything you needed if you wanted to cook, which we didn't.  But it was there.   Overall, I would recommend it.
1554	61052435	42400	8647034	Karen	The apartment was really clean.  The extras are great -hair dryer - kitchenette, microwave, large toaster oven, comfortable beds.  Even the towels are soft and large.  
1554	63510807	42423	54711594	Annarita	The host canceled this reservation 29 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1554	65351090	42442	50855115	Kelsey	I have loved everything about staying at the studio. The studio is much larger than I expected and the bed is the most comfortable bed I have ever slept on. I had a friend stay over and she also couldn't believe how comfortable the bed was. The television is great and has many channel options.  The studio has everything you could possibly need. It is not a far walk to the subway, which I take everyday.  It is also nice because the street doesn't get loud at night when you're trying to sleep, but if you walk 1.5 blocks there are a ton of great restaurants, cafes, and bars. This studio also has a washer and dryer which is very useful. Luis and Gladys are a delight! They are always available if I have any questions or need help. They were very warm upon my arrival, provided snacks for me, and have gone above and beyond.  I would highly recommend staying here to anyone and will definitely stay again when I come back to Brooklyn!
1554	76442268	42517	53509254	Purantharraj	I would highly recommend this place and the host are the best. You don't need to have second thoughts about booking this place. They have all the essential things required for the stay. I and my parents loved staying here and it was indeed an delightful experience.Thank you Luis. 
1554	77478220	42522	59265235	Mitra Varun	Luis' apartment was cute and cozy, just as pictured. Its in a beautiful neighborhood and the subway was a short walk. The kitchen was well stocked and Luis and his wife were helpful whenever we needed them and gave us complete privacy otherwise :) Would certainly recommend to others . Cheers :)  
1554	78770694	42530	14810973	Deborah	Everything went smoothly from check-in to check-out.  Gladys welcomed us and briefed us on the apartment facilities and amenities.  The special fruit basket provided for our pleasure was greatly appreciated. The place was exactly as described on the airbnb site; a super clean and spacious studio with a very comfortable bed.  There was plenty of privacy. We love to visit Bay Ridge because our grandchildren live there and the neighborhood offers a lot in the way of restaurants, shopping, and easy access to a beautiful park ad walkway along New York harbor.  It is also easy to take the train or bus to Manhattan.
1554	82041577	42547	76710413	Frank	Luis was a wonderful host! The apartment was very spacious, clean and in a convenient spot for going back and forth to Manhattan. This was my first AirBNB experience and I couldn't be happier. Highly recommended!
1554	84331013	42557	13833776	Jennifer	Had a really nice time house is clean and cute have no complaints about it.  :)
1554	87501854	42571	60521857	Sylvain	"Luis et son Ã©pouse son des notes super sympa.Ils sont accueillants, ouverts, cooools....ArrivÃ© chez Luis on se sent comme chez soit, avec tous Ã©quipements en ""All inclusives"" jusqu'au BBQ.Et plus le quartier est sympa et proche de la ligne R (Subway) qui permet de facilement aller partout Ã  NYC et pas interrompue le WE.Si j'ai besoin de retourner Ã  NYC j'irais chez Luis les yeux fermÃ©s, et si il veut venir faire un tour sur l'ancien continent, je l'accueille avec plaisir mÃªme si sa soeur est aussi en France.....Merc Ã  Luis et sa femme pour cet trÃ¨s agrÃ©able sÃ©jour."
1554	92171486	42589	12167673	Matt	Luis and Gladys were great hosts! Extremely accompanying and went above and beyond to help us out! The space was a pleasant surprise as well. Spacious, very clean, and fully stocked. Would definitely return and recommend to anyone looking for a great spot in Brooklyn! 
1554	98115771	42611	86709172	Brandy	They were a wonderful host for my friends and I over the weekend. Everything was very neat and matched what you see in the photos. This is actually my first time with Airbnb, and I could not be happier with my choice. The bed and couch were both very comfortable, and the place was very spacious for the three of us. The location is ideal when traveling from Brooklyn to Manhattan. Just a short walk to the train and you are set! I would definitely recommend. Very kind and helpful!!!
1554	99635167	42618	88298256	Ryan	Luis and Gladys were extremely welcoming, and even had started the air conditioning for us before our expected time of arrival, along with putting out some water and snacks!It's a beautiful space, and was very clean.Our hosts were also very helpful with recommendations to save some money on tourist stuff, and provided two sets of keys so that our group could conveniently split up to explore the city.I'd love to stay with them again!
1554	101962391	42629	82273372	Camilla	Nice hosts and a good place to stay. Place was like described. Nice and safe neighbourhood, close to the subway station. Location ideal if guest are planning to use subways to move around like we did. 
1554	102552645	42631	91555069	Dan	Luis was great he was very responsive when i called or sent a message.  he met me there when i arrived and walked me through the place and explained everything, He had out some fresh fruit and water in the fridge. The place is exactly what the pictures show it was very nice and clean, and the neighborhood was nice and quit. Would definitely recommend anyone to stay there.
1554	104143081	42638	11953698	Anna	it was wonderful. we all liked it! convenient location, cozy apartment! thank you!
1554	104957516	42642	93102509	Madhu	Thanks to Mr. Luis and his wife, they were an excellent host. They had kept fruits and water at check in. It is an apt place for business traveler and for families. The place is in a very safe locality and within 5 minutes of walk you can access everything, supermarkets, restaurants etc. The R train is a 10 minute walk.  I would stay at this place again and highly recommend 
1554	106676333	42650	63892394	Carmen	The house was much better than we had expected (really spacious, although it gets a bit hot but the a/c works perfectly!) and the area it's amazing! It is like a little town in the middle of Brooklyn. The tube is 10 minutes walk but even when we were coming back at 11pm we felt safe in the streets. Luis and his wife were lovely and they recommended a few places to visit in the area. They were for us in case we needed something. Definitely we'll be back, we couldn't be happier with our decision! 
1554	107655704	42654	96187283	Alissa	Great studio with a full kitchen. I stayed with my boyfriend and it was perfect for a couple. The neighborhood is great with tons of good food and bars. Easy trip to Manhattan. Definitely staying again if I come back to NYC
1554	108999516	42661	29827004	Taka	Luis' wife, Gladys welcomed us and gave us a quick tour of the studio.  She explained to us what we needed to know.  The place is clean and we were very pleased with their hospitality.  The studio was warm, but Gladys instructed us to use air conditioner when needed, and we did use it.  It was a very ward October in New York.
1554	109946491	42666	73085430	Keryn	Luis and Gladys are amazing hosts! The place was very clean and spacious, with water bottles stocked in the fridge when we arrived. They were so understanding and patient when we showed up almost two hours after our agreed time due to flight and traffic delays. Apartment is near R station as well as many restaurants and stores. Luis and Gladys have a great apartment in a safe neighborhood.
1554	111225804	42673	77681106	Uge	El apartamento es tal cual sale en las fotografias, muy cÃ³modo, limpio y bien conservado, a 8 minutos del metro,restaurantes y supermercados.Luis y Gladys nos estaban esperando a nuestra llegada, muy amables y simpaticos, nos obsequiaron con una cesta de fruta, agua. El trato con ellos ha sido formidable y de despedida nos ofrecieron un detalle, mejor imposible.Gracias Luis y Gladys
1554	114211036	42690	68842363	Danielle	We were met by Gladys who showed us her lovely apartment. The apartment was stocked with EVERYTHING that we needed to enjoy our visit. There was a basket of fresh fruit and bottled water upon our arrival. The apartment was extremely clean and well cared for, it had a very comfortable bed and lovely furnishings. The neighborhood was safe and quiet, close to all transit (bus, water taxi and train) This was a great home away from home! Thank you Luis and Gladys for opening your home to us.
1554	114891879	42694	64477054	Carl-Philippe	By far one of the best BnB's. Luis and his wife were extremely kind and hospitable. This was way beyond what  we imagined. It's a beautiful space in a great neighborhood. Anyone looking for a peaceful but yet fun stay Should book this. Very centralized and overall great. I'll recommend this place to anyone and everyone. 
1554	115702372	42700	76710413	Frank	Luis is very kind, wonderful place to stay, very clean and comfy,
1554	117041433	42708	105158368	Debra	My husband and I booked Luis' apartment for a long weekend to visit friends who live in Bay Ridge. Luis greeted us, gave us a tour of the apartment, had fresh fruit, clean linens, menus for local restaurants, and other amenities waiting for us upon arrival. He was very pleasant and the apartment was as advertised. The apartment is within walking distance to bars, restaurants, a gym, Starbucks, local markets - really, anything you need while away from home to feel comfortable and have fun! We would stay here again in a heartbeat. It was both economical, convenient, and a great home away from home for a weekend away. Thank you again, Luis!
1554	120714657	42715	103715303	Kelly	Wonderful place to stay!!!
1554	121891749	42723	100020242	Joseph	Simply the best for our stay.  Close to subway, restaurants, bars, anything you need is within blocks.  The place itself is fully stocked with bath products, toothpaste, towels, even shower loofahs!  Stove, microwave, full size fridge, queen bed, comfy couch.  Flat screen with premium channels and free wi-fi was greatly appreciated.  Top notch and very classy!  Hosts were super friendly and let us do our own thing. Check in/check out was a breeze, and they were super accommodating when it came to our flights being screwed up due to weather. This is THE BEST place to stay in Brooklyn.
1554	125021190	42738	36827748	Marta	It is a great place to stay, definitely recommend to everyone. The basement is located in a nice neighborhood not far from the subway station with a great number of restaurants and stores around.The hosts are great! Very helpful, friendly and nice. No problems with checking in and out, the place is very clean, with additional towels, dishes, utensils, even with board games.

1554	136920605	42806	48628133	Mackenzie	Had a great trip to Brooklyn in this spacious studio apartment. Easy to walk to the subway but also things to do in the area.

36059	8097500	41562	9032802	Vilma	We were staying at RicÂ´s place for two weeks, two girls from Finland. He is s real gentleman! A beautiful home, clean, cozy and roomy. A total no sight of any cockroaches, bedbugs or anything nasty. This place is clean and well taking care of in all ways.Nice neighborhood, safe for girls also. Good public transportation just few steps from apartments door. In RicÂ´s place you will have own privacy, but if needed he will help you with anyway he can. I can not come up with better place to stay while enjoying New York. I think we made a new friend from Ric!Vilma&Katja

Five minutes to parking, 1/2 minute to Metro station which directly take you to downtown area about 12 minutes. Ric respects guests privacy as well as you expected, meanwhile, kind to answers questions you have during stay. If you are looking a quite place to stay, here is what you absolutely don't want to missed for NYC vacation!
36059	20314703	41909	21326405	Oliver	Ric was a helpful and friendly host, but also gave me space to come and go as I pleased. The apartment was clean and comfortable and just as described.  The local neighbourhood felt friendly and safe and there are also a few nice coffee shops, food stores and restaurants nearby. The 181st St. A train subway station is very close and it is easy to get downtown. I had a pleasant week here and it was a good base for me in New York. I would be happy to stay here again.

36059	30959681	42123	476477	Llewellyn	Ric was a terrific host, always available by text or phone to answer any questions during my stay. He is a gentlemen and very easy to talk to and be around.

The neighborhood is lively, interesting, full of good restaurants and grocery stores, and ridiculously close to the A express train.I highly recommend booking with Ric.

The apartment is always clean, super comfortable and just cute. I love this place. The location is perfect. The A train runs every few minutes and is 2 minutes walk away. Perfect :) I loved spending time with Ric and having a good glas of wine in the evening. Thank you Ric for being such a great tour guide. I went to places I've never seen before :))And just to prepare you: I'll come back soon :) :) 
36059	36789893	42186	5571273	Vivek	First, the room is exactly how it is in the picture. It is very clean and located in a very safe locality. I came really late in the nights and it was all good. Everything is located in the near vicinity - food, coffee, stores, trains...!Ric is a fantastic guy, we had great conversations whenever we could.

If I ever needed anything, he was very easy to get ahold of. He was also very respectful of privacy. His home was very nice and cleanliness was very important to him. The apartment always looked nice and tidy. The room I stayed in was very comfy and cozy as well. And his apartment was in an awesome location. Right next to the A express train which was very convenient. If you are interested in his private room, I would definitely recommend staying with Ric. Thanks again Ric for opening your home to me. It was very nice to meet you!Take care,Chris Borrero 
36059	57052850	42359	46862341	Victor	Ric has a nice apartment.  The neighborhood is good and it's really close to the A train, which is extremely convenient.  
36059	73773027	42500	8750097	Gurminder & Misha	Ric was an absolutely amazing host and made us both feel very comfortable in his home. For a NYC apartment the room & apartment is very very spacious and clean! 
36059	74434957	42505	58585286	Leslie	El lugar es super apropiado, esta cerca a laEstacion del subway, y encuentras tiendas y restaurantes cerca, en general todo estuvo muy bien, el dormitorio super limpio y ordenado, Ric es muy amable y da una muy buena atencion. 
36059	101482466	42626	94605145	Ira	The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
36059	101488324	42626	15768961	Rodrigo	Ric was a great host. He made it easy for checking in and out, provided the help I needed, and the place is exactly as described. It's very close to major subway stations. Overall, I would recommend to stay with Ric.

27558	129207658	42764	69695681	Leo	Great place to stay, George was really a great host. He made sure that I was comfortable and even went above that by providing some amenities

27558	137770070	42811	4861475	Lorenz	Great stay, very friendly host and very nice, quiet apartment.
27558	138934950	42816	30181513	Diana	Great apartment and super nice and friendly host! Will definitely book again in the future and recommend to others! Location was really convenient and there was a 1 subway entrance just two minutes walk away! We had a really comfortable and pleasant stay!
27558	141285300	42827	33710929	Wendy	Small, clean, convenient apartment! It was so convenient being less than a block away from the subway station. It was never too quiet at night for me to be scared because the street it is on has many restaurants beside it so people are usually around. The apartment was small but of course because you're in a city. The room was perfect for two and the bathroom was nice and clean. George is super friendly and what makes him great is how quickly he responds to any questions or problems you have. He helped make booking, checking in, and the general stay easy and great! Be warned that it is up on the 6th floor and although he does provide some bathroom amenities, it's best to bring your own body wash, shampoo, etc. He provides all the bedding and towels too! But honestly, whatever you don't have, there's a Duane Reades like a Walgreen, across the street so I bought whatever else I didn't bring! Overall the stay was great. In my opinion, I got a great deal for this housing as it provides exactly what we needed (a bed for the night after a long day of venturing through the city) and it's super convenient and safe location. I recommend and would be willing to come back next time! 
17626	102555000	42631	42504554	Christopher	Wendy is a great host. The apartment is very clean, and located in East Village - fantastic neighborhood. Wendy was nice enough to provide me with toiletries I forgot to bring, and other amenities as part of my stay! :)
17626	109881945	42666	28359542	Ramon	Wendy was a great host and her space meets the requirements for a nice stay in manhattan.  Location is excellent, one block from subway station.Would recommend this space and stay again in the future.
17626	110966065	42672	66897489	Kyle	Wendy is great. The location is within easy walking distance of Union Square where you can get a train to pretty much anywhere in the city.
17626	114442728	42692	22816573	Ruben	Great location, top starting point to discover NY. 
17626	138961985	42816	86792060	Alexander	Wendy was an awesome host
32210	69056138	42468	31426660	Andrea And Yuqi	My experience of staying with Andrea was awesome! She kept a lovely apartment, which was quiet, nice and clean. The space of the room was good and the bed was comfortable. I was allowed to use the fridge, and the kitchen. Andrea was very friendly and helpful, providing me with the best recommendations of what to see and where to eat. I also found it easy to navigate in the area. And I also have to mention a gem near her place thanks to Andrea's recommendation, Carl Schultz Park by the river - it is so beautiful and peaceful! It was a lot of fun visiting NYC, and I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Andrea again when I return! Great place, and great host. Thank you Andrea.
32210	71817782	42488	5532926	Tracey	Andreas place was very clean and quiet and Andrea was super nice and responsive. 
32210	73948299	42501	29863380	ClÃ©mence	Bon accueil, chaleureux, les explications Ã©taient claires et simples Ã  suivre. Andrea a su rÃ©pondre Ã  nos demandes et a su nous laisser profiter de notre sÃ©jour. La chambre est bien sÃ©parÃ©e de l'espace oÃ¹ vit notre hÃ´te de cette maniÃ¨re nous Ã©tions autonomes et Ã  l'aise malgrÃ© les espaces partagÃ©s. C'est un vrai lit plutÃ´t confortable, la chambre est assez grande pour y laisser nos valises et nos affaires, une grande cuisine et une petite salle de bain sont Ã  disposition. Andrea nous a fourni des serviettes de bain et a laissÃ© des produits de toilette Ã  notre disposition. Station de vÃ©lo Ã  quelques rues de l'appartement dans un quartier plutÃ´t animÃ© avec un 24/7 juste en face, trÃ¨s pratique ! Une vingtaine de dollars pour rentrer en taxi le soir depuis Times square. 
32210	74633004	42506	26000696	Amelie	The host canceled this reservation 22 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
32210	74949729	42507	9073150	Piotr	Room was very nice, clean and quiet. Location was perfect, with safe neiborghood and close to metro station. Andrea is a very nice and helpfull person. 
32210	75214105	42509	33403092	Kyle	We stopped into New York for a 2 day exploration trip and stayed with Andrea. Andrea was extremely helpful and very accommodating. The room was small but that's just how New York is. Had a great time and would definitely do it again.
32210	75625503	42512	10586686	Assunta	sono stata ospite di Andrea dal 20 maggio al 30 maggio.Andrea Ã¨ stata molto accogliente, la stanza Ã¨ cosi come la si vede dalle foto.la stanza Ã¨ molto carina collegata alla cucina e al bagno... piÃ¹ che una stanza privata sembra un monolocale.Andrea Ã¨ una host affidabilissima, la raccomando a tutti.
32210	82235571	42547	22557661	Danny	She is friendly and her place is close to public transports.
32210	82873479	42551	76114917	Julia	Andrea was a great host, she always replied to our questions within a few minutes. The apartment was very clean and comfortable and we really had our privacy. The overall experience was great!
32210	85161943	42561	70803520	Catharina	Andrea is a very friendly and helpful person. My room was small but clean. The weather in New York was very hot and thereby also my room. The location from the flat was great and I had a safe neighborhood with a good infrastructure. I can recommend the apartment.
32210	86902502	42569	73959871	å®?	Very convenient!we had 5 good nights!
32210	89577301	42580	75222646	Sophie	SÃ©jour agrÃ©able mais il a fait trÃ¨s chaud
32210	89930773	42581	49245686	Xiang	Very nice host and convenient traffic, a great place to stay.
32210	90579252	42583	57630728	Iris	Andrea was very friendly and welcoming for our stay at her apartment. The neighborhood felt safe and the location was convenient to public transportation via bus and subway. 
32210	91467366	42587	80226569	Leonardo	Excelente experiencia al hospedarme con Andrea.  Muy buena zona, con todo lo necesario a poca distancia.  Acceso muy cerca a las lineas 4,5,6 del subway para transportase a practicamente cualquier punto de la ciudad.  Si buscan un lugar comodo y privado para dormir durante su estadia en NY, recomiendo este lugar de Andrea.
32210	92127428	42589	44510261	Cassie	Andrea was available for any questions with quick responses.  She was extremely hospitable and the location was really great.  I would stay here again!
32210	92690061	42591	77524583	Rica	Nice little apartment, perfekt to stay a couple nights in New York City. Andrea is friendly and open to help you with your questions. 
32210	93134075	42593	57139212	Ariell	The host canceled this reservation 42 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
32210	93160540	42593	50076624	Spencer	Andrea was absolutely fantastic. The apartment was in a great location, exactly as described. But it was Andrea herself that really made our stay. We locked ourselves out of the apartment around 1:30 in the morning, and had to wake her up to get back in. She was friendly, understanding, and personable. It was greatly appreciated. Would definitely stay here again!!
32210	94210634	42597	77313109	Yolanta	Everything was OK.
32210	94675503	42598	37157340	Andrew	Andrea was a great host in a great neighborhood, but the room itself was a little disappointing. The thin mattress sat on a weak futon frame; we were under the impression it was a standard full-size bed. Furthermore, there were a significant amount of ants in the bathroom.
32210	96190047	42604	47056423	Megan	Andrea was very kind and helpful upon arrival.  It is in a great location, and feels safe and is quiet.  
32210	96925873	42607	72307638	Roberto	Andrea Ã¨ stata precisa e puntuale nelle informazioni e rispettosa della privacy. L' appartamento si trova in una buona zona e con negozi e ristoranti.
32210	99313434	42617	54747819	Pau	Andrea was very friendly, because our flight was delayed we arrive at the apartment at 2:30am and she was waiting for us.The place was small but comfortable,a little hot at night but just for the night and rest for the next day.we can use the kitchen and well equipped, helped us a lot to not spend so much on food outside in a city as expensive as NYC.We had a great time and I can recommend for someone who wants to be near Central Park, in a quiet neighborhood with supermarkets nearby and above all to enjoy the city.Thank you Andrea for all your kindness! Paula and Diego!
32210	100572128	42623	53308879	Arnau	La estancia en casa de Andrea ha sido muy agradable, la habitaciÃ³n es la que se muestra en la fotografÃ­a, sencilla, limpia y ordenada. Hemos estado muy cÃ³modos en todo momento.La ubicaciÃ³n es muy buena, esta muy cerca del Central Park y de una parada de metro favorable.En el entorno del piso hay buen ambiente y hay varios restaurantes, cafeterÃ­as y supermercados.
32210	102033949	42629	34936583	Gina	Andrea was a great host! I arrived to NYC on an early flight and she worked with me on getting the keys early so I could put my bag down. She stays in part of her apartment that is partitioned and you don't even know she is there. We had full reign of a (very clean) bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen that was in a beautiful neighborhood. It is on a 4th floor walkup (no elevator) so if you have issues with stairs you might have a hard time. It was about a 15 minute walk to the subway and 20 minute walk to Central Park. Next time I come to New York I will definitely be staying with Andrea!
32210	105764440	42645	69569364	Matias	Alojamiento Ok, en un buen y tranquilo barrio en Upper East Side. Cerca al metro y buses. Queda en un cuarto piso sin ascensor, donde tienes acceso directo a cocina y baÃ±o. El cuarto de la dueÃ±a queda por otro lado, y ella usa una puerta alternativa. La cocina no es tan compelta, ya que podrÃ­an haber mas vasos o utencilios basicos com cucharas, tenedores y cuchillos. El refrigerador es grande por lo que puedes usarlo con comodidad. El cuarto es pequeÃ±o pero suficiente, ya que pasas todo el dÃ­a afuera. Dado que estabamos tan cansados al final del dia, no sientes lo dura que es la cama ya que es bajita y quedas muy cerca del suelo. En general ok si vas a pasar poco tiempo en la casa.

32210	106853996	42651	9767274	Benson	"Andrea's place is about 3 avenues away from the nearest subway station (86 St; 4,5,6 line). The Neighbourhood is safe and there's lots of shopping that could be done. The room that she's hosting are separated from a curtain. Privacy wise not that good.While it was not a perfect stay for me, I would say Andrea was very accommodating. I require to check out late, she has no issue with that. Whether her place is recommended for stay, I would say it would be more appropriate for backpackers who is more care less about privacy during their sleep. Notwithstanding this, Andrea will obviously not draw open the curtain. It is just the feeling of feeling ""porous""."
32210	108828869	42660	40294777	Rj	Andrea was very accomodating, having her parents available for me to check-in on arrival.  The room is relatively spacious for a NYC apartment.  I stayed in the BR pictured on the ad and had use of the kitchen and privacy to get to the bathroom.  The neighborhood is safe, and the apartment access is all hours, a 4th floor walk-up.  It is close to the 86th St. bus route and a few blocks from the 4,5,6 subway line and Central Park.  Overall, I think a good value.
