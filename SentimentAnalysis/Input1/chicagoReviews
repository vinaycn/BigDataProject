984850	3842244	41352	2451763	Francess	We were a party of 7 had an awesome stay at Mikes, great host very communicative and answers any questions you have. The penthouse is very cozy and clean with a great location close to the important places of downtwon Chicago.  I would book with Mike anytime again.
984850	4255063	41386	5666322	Jonathan	We were looking for a place to stay while celebrating my friend's bachelor party (off site). I searched all over Craigslist, VRBO, and AirBnB and finally found Michael's Penthouse. During the booking process Michael communicated promptly and answered all my questions. On the day of our reservation we were running a little behind due to traffic. Michael was more than accomidating and waited until we arrived. Once we arrived and secured parking we made the long walk up to the penthouse on the 3rd floor. Its a very long stair case up, quite the workout :). Everything inside was immaculate, well maintained and ready for our stay. During our weekend we enjoyed playing pool on the vintage table. Which also converts for ping pong. We also made use of the TV and PS3 while we were there. Lots of games and movies to choose from. There are TVs located in almost every room. There is also a dartboard but you will need to bring your own darts if you want to play. One of the coolest amenities was the state-of-the-art shower. Complete w/ digital temperature control and steam system. You will want to upgrade once you get home!The Penthouse is located right above a couple bars and isn't too far from the local nightlife. If you were looking to head to other parts of the city finding a cab in the area isn't too hard. The rooftop deck provide and incredible view and a good place to smoke cigars. There is a fridge located up there as well.   Unfortunately it was a little cold for us most of the night but I can imagine it would be a blast during the summer. The kitchen contained everything we need to cook through out our stay. There is a second small fridge located under the bar which was a nice surprise when we ran out of room in the main one. The only issue we ran into was parking. There is street parking but it is only free from 9pm to 9am.   There is a parking garage conveniently located across the street but expect to pay $25 per day. Over all we had a great time. I'd recommend Michael's Penthouse to anyone looking for a place to stay while visiting Chicago. If you have a fairly large group (7-8 people) this is way cheaper than most hotels and much cooler having your own space for your vacation. 
984850	4347678	41393	3189829	Meg And Greg	We had so much fun staying at the penthouse! We were a group of six women getting together for a bachelorette weekend in Chicago. It was a perfect walk to the lake and really fund bars and shops.  The space is gigantic and the kitchen was perfect for our family style meals. Michael was responsive and helpful over e-mail. This place even has roof access!
984850	4450727	41400	5642894	Steven	This was my first rental on airbnb.  It has made me a fan of this concept and has set the bar very high for all future rentals thorugh this website.This place was fantastic.  I received compliments from all of my guests; they all wanted to know how I had found this place.  The penthouse was spacious and well located.  Michael keeps the apartment in top shape.  He left it for us with clean sheets, towels, soaps and shampoos.  He even left us a bottle of champagne and orange juice to help celebrate my friend's upcoming wedding.The amenities in this apartment are top-notch.  The beds are comfortable, the bathrooms are modern and luxurious.  The TV and sound system are great.  We loved the pool table/pingpong table set up.Michael was courteous, friendly and professional.  He met us at the apartment and walked us aroudn the place -- and up to the roof deck (which is a big bonus with vierws of the Sears tower).We couldn't have asked for  a better place to spend our Chicago weekend.Michael was 
984850	4596397	41408	5609038	Mike	We flew in from Toronto and stayed here over the weekend with a group of 7 for my brothers bachelor party. When I first saw the pictures on airbnb I assumed they were playing with perspective to make it look bigger but boy was I wrong. The place is unbelievable. Exposed brick, aged wooden windows and columns all mixed with modern and trendy kitchen, bedrooms and amenities. Have you ever pushed a button to start and stop a shower? I now have..The location is steps away from all the best party spots in Chicago. OldTown is up the street, Rush and Division a few blocks to the east. Going to see the SOX play was 2 blocks (3 minute walk) to the red line subway. Everything else seemed to be a $6 cab ride away.There's a pool table. This converts easily into a ping pong table, which I would say got the most attention from us. There was always the dart board aswell. This is the ultimate bachelor pad, bar none. I almost forgot to mention, you got a roof top patio with great views of the city.Michael was always easily accessible by email and even by text message. He was professional and courteous at all times. Met us right when we got there to check in and showed us around the place. I would definitely rent there again. Everyone that stayed with us had nothing but compliments about the penthouse.Thanks Michael! 
984850	4677781	41414	2751363	Caroline	This apartment was the perfect place to host a bunch of friends for my wedding.  It was a great place for all to stay and hang out and we were tempted to not go out and see the city as the apartment was so much fun and comfortable.  Michael was great and was there in case we needed him, but the apartment ended up being extremely convenent and it felt like home after a the first night.  The location is perfect for restaurants, getting downtown or uptown, or just a few short minutes to the beautiful Oak Street Beach or the famous Magnificent Mile!!  If you're looking for a perfect place to stay in Chicago this is it.  If you're from Chicago or have never been to Chicago before this is the perfect place for you.
984850	4905129	41426	1477471	Mark	Great place and location.  Michael was a great host and very responsive!
984850	5050733	41435	5550679	Jordan	Michael's penthouse is a fantastic place to book your stay in Chicago!  We had a group of 6 for a bachelor party and the place exceeded out expectations.  There is plenty to do inside and is conveniently located around many restaurants and bars.  We were met at the agreed upon time by the property manager and things went very smoothly during our stay.  I highly recommend you choose Michael's penthouse during your stay in Chicago, you will not regret it!
984850	5240901	41445	5264030	Cathy	"LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this beautiful Penthouse!  We were a group of 6 Human Resources Pros who came to Chicago for our National Convention at McCormick.  Michael greeted us on our first night with the grand tour, a bottle of wine,  and as he left said ""the place is yours"".  He was also very responsive to a couple of questions that were promptly answered via text.  Our only regret was that we were so busy at the conference that we did not have much time to relax and enjoy the penthouse and roof top deck.  We will definetly be back and next time make sure we have time to RELAX and ENJOY!  Thank you Michael! "
984850	5309962	41449	5743667	Jenna	Five of my girlfriends and I stayed at Michael's Penthouse in downtown Chicago for the weekend for a girls weekend to celebrate my upcoming wedding.  The pictures do not do it justice.  It is absolutely beautiful!  It was very clean, spacious, and comfortable.  We had several mid day brunches, appetizers before going out for the night and the space couldn't have been more perfect.  The beds were very comfortable, and there were also miscellaneous toiletries provided as well which was nice for all of the guests that flew there and may have forgotten a lint brush, etc.  Michael was extremely responsive and also followed up on our stay as well.  It gave us peace of mind knowing he was available in case we had any questions or concerns.  The location is also very close to many restaurants, and downtown sites.  The rooftop patio was also an added bonus and had beautiful views of downtown Chicago.  I would definitely recommend staying in this condo.  Thank you Michael for everything! 
984850	5600996	41463	5380251	Alexander	Beautiful condo that my friends and I rented to celebrate our 30th birthdays.  Owners were kind and accommodating.  I'd recommend this to anyone who likes nice places in the heart of town. 
984850	5823518	41473	5697394	Thomas	We stayed at Michael's place earlier this month.  We stayed for five days, total party of six, including two teenage boys.  The setup was well-suited for us. The property lived up to both the description on this website, as well as previously published reviews.  Yes, it is as cool as it looks in the pix!  The kitchen is well stocked with utensils, et al.  Bedding = best evs!  It is evident that the owner cares about his property; it is well looked after.Michael was very good to deal with in all aspects of the booking / stay, and he responded quickly to any questions raised. I would look forward to staying here again, and I'd recommend it to friends.  
984850	5937970	41478	3265177	Kirby	The loft was very large and nicely appointed.  There were toiletries made available for us in the bathrooms, a bottle of champagne waiting for us, and all aspects of the reservation went off without a hitch.Also, there were 2 divvybike stations, and an L station easy walking distance; great stay.
984850	6236853	41491	455604	Steven	Michaels Chicago Loft was perfect for our groups first visit to Chicago. The owner and his property manager were extremely responsive to our needs. The photos do not exaggerate as the place is beautiful. The location was perfectly located near the metro and convenient to numerous landmarks in the city. 
984850	6811402	41512	6304790	Pedro	We stayed at Michaelâ€™s place from August 22 until August 25th. It was fantastic, and we would highly recommend it to anyone looking to stay in Chicago.-Great location â€“ although we are from NYC, from what we could tell, Old Town is a great area of the city. It is close to downtown and the lake. There are great neighborhood bars as well. If you are looking to use the great kitchen to cook meals, there are also two grocery stores within walking distance. There is also a liquor store right beneath the apartment.-Great space â€“ the apartment is very spacious, especially the common area and the master bedroom. We rented with a group of 6, so that large common area was perfect for us. There is a small pool table that also converts into a ping-pong table, which we used consistently all weekend.-Roof deck â€“ there is a shared roof deck with the downstairs neighbor, who is very friendly and welcoming.All-in-all, our weekend was perfect thanks to this wonderful apartment. 
984850	7479700	41539	5867116	Annette	Beautiful apartment, great location. Would definitely stay again.Thank you
984850	7839710	41552	2118303	Danielle	Michael was an amazing host! Prompt response and extremely friendly and helpful to work with. Casey was fantastic as well! The penthouse is an awesome place in the city. Clean, comfortable, great location and exactly as pictured. Checkin/out was as easy as could be. Thank you Michael and Casey!! Looking forward to coming back soon. 
984850	7869289	41554	1661828	Abbey	The penthouse is just a great as the previous reviewers  have said - beautiful place.  Plus, the logistics were much easier than other rentals I've done - it makes a big difference having a dedicated property manager.  Communication with Casey was super prompt and easy.  Thank you!
984850	8077006	41562	2016188	Andrea	We stayed at Michael's place to run the Chicago Marathon and it was the perfect spot! Excellent accommodations and service from the property manager Casey. Great location with easy access to  the whole city. Would love to stay here again and would recommend it to anyone. 
984850	8378168	41575	9141603	Chris	We were a family of six and this wonderful apartment was the perfect find.  Location is great, if you're coming by car there's parking literally across the road next to a Plum Market which is one of the best grocery stores on Planet Earth!  When we showed the family pictures of the apartment before we arrived they all said that in real life the place would likely be much smaller.  How they were wrong, what you see is what you get and it is A LOT.  Michael and Casey always answered their phone even over the weekend and jumped on any questions/issue we had.   Will definitely book again when we're next in Chicago.  Just one warning...the staircase up to the apartment isn't for the old or infirm (especially with suitcases) but helps to burn off the calories you'll be acquiring during your stay!
984850	8517563	41582	8001284	Sue	This Penthouse is beautiful.  I was there for a reunion with my college housemates, and we had a wonderful time.  It is located within walking distance to shopping and great restaurants.The only reason I didn't give this penthouse a 5 star is that it only has 3 beds and 1 air mattress.  So it only sleeps 7 comfortably.  The airbnb website says it sleeps 10.  We originally had 9 reserved to stay.  The 3 extra would have slept on the couch in the great room.  Maybe because of our age, and the cost for the extra guests, we found this unacceptable.  Fortunately only 7 of us were able to stay overnight.  Michael and Casey were awesome though.  Casey was very helpful, and we really appreciated her help.  All 7 of us agreed that we would stay here again, as long as we have 7 guests or less!
984850	11171091	41722	11223896	Sara	michael was a fantastic host and casey was great to work with!  the space is gorgeous, has tons of room and offers a ton of great upgrades - the heated floors in the master bath were much appreciated!  highly, highly recommend!!
984850	11984331	41750	1948456	Justin	My friends and I had a great time staying here!  The unit is large and extremely comfortable.  Casey made sure that we had everything we needed, and check-in/check-out was a breeze.  Highly recommended.
984850	12544918	41764	8609808	Abby	The penthouse was great! Just as described. It was easy to get into and has everything we needed. Casey was super responsive and helpful. The neighborhood was great- centrally located and we were able to walk nearly everywhere we wanted to go. Highly recommend the penthouse for a large group, we were very happy with our choice. Thank you!
984850	13349692	41785	12895461	Alexander	Good responsiveness, flexible with # of guests as our #s changed, description as expected.  Nice place, perfect for group of guys.
984850	13649159	41792	6584657	Kristen	This place was amazing and located in the best neighborhood in Chicago! I felt like I was on an episode of MTV Cribs. Everything was clean, the beds were super comfy, & the rooftop was a fun place to hang. We were able to cook a lot  in the kitchen and saved a lot of money eating out! Would totally stay here again! The hosts were super easy to work with! 
984850	15877170	41837	3260084	David	Michael's place is ideally located & has a lovely spacious feel, not to mention the snooker table & jacuzzi bath. The bed in the master bedroom also had the softest sheets I've ever slept on. :)
984850	16076610	41842	13809372	Michael	I hesitate to let out the secret but this place was incredible.  Spacious, clean, and luxurious.  The whole process was a breeze and Casey was easy to contact.  The location couldn't have been better; we used the train station two blocks away, walked to the beach, and there are dozens of bars and restaurants along Wells St. just out the door.  Also, Plum Grocery store was outstanding and right across the street.  Will definitely rent again for a high-quality Chicago weekend.  
984850	16448826	41848	11612728	Patrick	The TopstepTrader Chicago Penthouse was great! Just as described. It was easy to get into and has everything we needed. Casey was super responsive and helpful. The neighborhood was great- centrally located and we were able to walk nearly everywhere we wanted to go. Highly recommend the penthouse for a large group, we were very happy with our choice. Thank you!
984850	16785743	41853	11467905	Maurice	Amazing place, will stay here again. Close to all the amazing things Chicago has to offer. Old town at your door step and northern river restaurants a few blocks away. You should def stay here. 
984850	16914426	41855	4722990	John	Michael was an awesome host. He made sure everything was taken care of for us and he communicated with us to make sure everything met our needs. Our group agreed that the penthouse went above and beyond expectations and it will be the go to spot for us to stay in Chicago going forward.
984850	17493890	41863	17285961	Marion	The reservation was canceled 21 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
984850	18701651	41882	5374299	Christine	The listing was very accurate except that the jacuzzi was what we would call and spa bath and so not as we were expecting but I think that's more of a language confusion rather than an inaccurate description. The flat was very clean and tidy and well equipped. It was a shame that the ping pong table was not available but we did have great fun with the pool table. The local area was fantastic. We had many breakfasts at Hash Browns and shopped frequently at both Plum Market and the nearest Jewel Osco.In terms of cleanliness the only criticism I have is that the bath mat in the downstairs bathroom was sodden when we arrived which was not pleasant but it came up fine in a wash.
984850	19910044	41902	16673230	Terrance	The unit was awesome. Great views from the rooftop. Everything was exactly as described in the pictures. The location was right near tons of restaurants and entertainment. I will definitely make this a regular stay for business trips to Chicago. 
984850	20613517	41914	16958056	Kate	Great rooftop, excellent soft towels, linens, shower, and bath. Enjoyed the stereo while playing pool and darts. 
984850	23146581	41967	12604578	Virginia	Great spot!  Perfect for our group of friends who stayed there. Very cool vibe. Great neighbourhood with lots of amenities close by, including Plum Market across the street with upscale snacks etc.  Very responsive hosts - There was a technical problem with the keypad lock mid-stay and it was attended to promptly - plus they delivered a bottle of champagne to us for our trouble (which was really not much trouble at all). Gotta love it!Would highly recommend this spot for families or groups of friends who want a memorable and cool Chicago stay.  Hope we get the chance to stay there again!!
984850	26428394	42047	25411450	Janine	This is a beautiful home!  Michael & Casey provided us with great directions on how to access the home and utilize it to the best of our ability.  Will definitely keep this place in mind for future stays! 
984850	29129394	42098	2217840	Casey	This place was amazing. Everything was as described.
984850	29356814	42100	20671574	Daewun	The place was very clean and spacious.  The location is great since all the amenities are in walking distance. It is close to the clark and division red line stop on the EL.  The place also had toiletries and towels.  We highly recommend staying here.
984850	29862711	42107	20445578	Jordan	Amazing Condo. The space was better than the pictures and the rooftop was amazing. It was very easy to park, find the unit and access the condo. Michael's directions and recommendations were spot on. We will definitely be staying again and I would recommend it to anyone.....thanks!
984850	30037219	42110	29999825	Stephanie	Two of my colleagues stayed here during a convention instead of an overpriced hotel room. Here is their review:We very much enjoyed our stay and would highly recommend to others. Plenty of closet space, clean, lots of supplies in the bathrooms, and beds were comfortable. Steam shower in the master bath is amazing (though the digital controls are a bit confusing). Sound system + dart board = something fun to do after dinner. Another perk is the location â€“ there is an Intelligentsia coffee shop on the same block across the street, as well as a Plum Market (a regional chain that is essentially equivalent to a small Whole Foods). A few bars and convenience stores right next door as well but we didnâ€™t go to any of them. Thanks for a great stay!
984850	31583407	42131	26987852	Carolyn	The penthouse was a lovely stay for the four of us. It was well appointed and had very comfortable beds. The location was great; we walked everywhere we needed to go. Best of all was that the oldest store in Old Town was right below us: a gorgeous wine shop! Casey was responsive and easy to work with. 
984850	32845902	42146	26160023	Steve	Easy to find and enter. Stunning space. Interesting area with many independent shops and restaurants. There on business so not much time to explore.
984850	33216157	42150	5168004	Nidhi	Great place! 
984850	35454371	42174	999689	Eric	Michael's place was great! Exactly as advertised. Check-in was a breeze and the location can't be beat. Highly recommended!
984850	36512728	42184	5005857	Dorian	Wow.  What an incredible space.   The enormous loft is an incredible space for our trip to Chicago.  There were four of us and the place was immaculate, the located great and the checkin process very easy.  Michael was in great communication with us and we had a wonderful time.  Would highly recommend this place to others.
984850	38254927	42199	28638339	Joshua	Neighborhood was beautiful, the loft was fantastic and the host was great. Easily one of the best experiences I've had. Thanks for the great time.
984850	38995382	42205	31414357	Joe	Beautiful place. Great location. Loved the pool table. Nice view from the roof. A very enjoyable weekend stay.
984850	39901448	42212	26797295	Jessica	We stayed here for a girls weekend (there were 7 of us), and loved the space! It looked just like the pictures - extremely spacious, the kitchen was beautiful and fully stocked with anything needed, the beds were comfy, and the master bath was beautiful. The roof deck had a nice view of the city. It's in a wonderful neighborhood - close to the lake, shopping, restaurants, and bars. Very fun experience! 
984850	41063538	42220	3118854	Nick	Place was awesome great location Casey gave us all the information we needed.
984850	41922278	42226	29451651	Maxwell	Amazing location, beautiful penthouse, skyline view on roof, very accommodating host
984850	43149558	42233	38578112	Chris	The property is exactly as it is described and in an incredible location.  The penthouse was spotless.  Getting in and out with a code as opposed to a key is genius - everyone should do this.  Casey was great to work with.  While we were just here as a family of 4 - the property would be great for a girls getaway - a bachelor or couples retreat.  Being in old town - you are outside of the regular tourist traffic and in with the natives - but you are close enough to walk everywhere.  Loved it.
984850	46116417	42255	25915816	Chad	Great location!! Easy to get everywhere in the city. Right next to the train station to get to wrigleyville and an easy walk to magnificent mile.  
3529765	18179136	41874	3529379	Allison	Amina was very welcoming and informative. The apartment is huge! I think the early 20th century architecture was charming; one of the things people love about Chicago. Roger's Park is definitely my kind of neighborhood, the beach,Lake Michigan, is a few steps away. Lots of diverse restaurants to eat from, people are friendly. Festivals to enjoy music, art, delicious food. Transportation was super easy,the red line is right up the street and only a few stops from the city. I had a great experience overall, would definitely book again!!
3529765	33262051	42150	13969458	Joyce	Though I only had email contact with Amina, she was lovely and helpful. The apartment is large as she has described with a kitchen, dining room, living room, bedroom and bath. It is older but everything was clean. The apartment is in a very nice, typical Chicago neighborhood  apartment building on a treelined street. The train station is only a 5 minute pleasant (and safe :-) ) walk. There is a nice coffee shop and grocery store along the way. With a multi-day train pass you can get off and on the train as often as you like and go practically anywhere in Chicago. (Just the way those passes in other cities are supposed to work but often don't!)
4395839	32855042	42146	32912831	JosÃ©	Damian war ein unkomplizierter, freundlicher und respektvoller Gastgeber mit dem es einfach war zu kommunizieren und der sehr schnell auf Fragen einging. Die Wohnung liegt sehr gut im Norden der Stadt, nahe der Red Line, die rund um die Uhr fÃ¤hrt, in unmittelbarer NÃ¤he zum See und in der NÃ¤he von Wrigley's Field, Boystown und Andersonville. Ins Zentrum sind es mit der Bahn ca. 20 Minuten. Die Mitbewohner waren alle umgÃ¤nglich und hilfsbereit und respektierten gleichzeitig die PrivatsphÃ¤re. Und Gwen, der Hund, war fÃ¼r mich persÃ¶nlich ein Highlight. Das Zimmer ist klein, war aber fÃ¼r mich alleine als Schlafplatz und RÃ¼ckzugsmÃ¶glichkeit ausreichend und hatte seinen Charme! Schnell fÃ¼hlt man sich als Teil der Wohngemeinschaft.
4395839	33868621	42156	32378356	Joshua	Couldn't recommend staying here enough.   Damian was gone for the weekend but he was immediately responsive with my questions.   Shane (and Gwen the dog) was there to greet me and show me around the place so I could settle in.   We went out to a festival with his other roommates/friends and had a great time.   I can't wait to get back there again for another one. The room was perfect for what I needed,  and they had another room better suited for couples which was gigantic.  The location was close to the red line which takes you to Wrigley and further into downtown in no time. All in all - awesome experience.
4395839	35050471	42169	8660834	Neal	excellent stay. perfect location, cool guys
4395839	35146999	42170	34616473	Apoorv	It was a nice, cozy room. Except for the small confusion regarding key transfer, we had a very smooth stay.
4395839	36636070	42184	36698383	Andrew	Damian was an accommodating and welcoming host. The room is located in a neighborhood convenient to the Red Line to get around, as well as busses. There are a number of places to eat nearby. There is actually a target within walking distance so you can really get anything you might need. The room is comfortable and private. I had no problems with noise inside or outside. The most unique aspect of the property is the well-mannered house dog, Gwen. She is a real sweetie; when I would go into a room, I would often find her lying in front of the door waiting for me to come out. I would definitely recommend this room.
4395839	37387866	42191	36392279	Enrique	They made us feel very welcomed, it was a small room as described, but we were able to have some good sleep there, at the beginning we thought it was going to be maybe a bad experience with people partying all the time, but it wasnt that way, Damian and his roommates were very kind with us always, providing us of any information we need, and trying to make our stay more comfortable. I totally recommended to stay with them.
4395839	38553572	42201	18564220	Danny	Damian and his roommates were extremely welcoming, friendly, and helpful.  They gave very good advice on where to go, what to do, what to eat, and how to get there.  They also gave me my privacy when ever I was in my room which was real nice.  The location is a good spot too, it's  walking distance from the red line and Wrigley Field.  For the price it cannot be beat.  
4395839	39559215	42209	37724846	Gail	"Damian was great! I arrived late to my ""Cozy Room"" and he and his brother were very accommodating. We talked for a bit the first night, Damian made sure I got a key and that was the last I saw of him and all the roommates! (Except for the dog, who greeted me when I arrived the second night! Very friendly!) The apt was clean and comfortable. It was a very good first experience with AirB2B."
4395839	40177362	42213	11546974	Brian	Damien and his roommates were really cool guys and exceptionally welcoming. The room was perfect for what I needed. They gave great advice on the area and I even managed to check out one of their comedy shows in the Buena Park area. All round positive experience and highly recommended. 
4395839	41028430	42219	39358803	Barbara	Very nice experience. Stayed at Damian's place for 2 nights, and he and his flatmates are very friendly and helpful. It's a good place to stay, close to public transport and easy to get to. 
4395839	44266545	42240	28771929	Aaron	I couldn't have asked for a better experience staying at Damian's place. All of the guys are extremely friendly and helpful, just really some of the nicest guys you'll ever meet. My girlfriend and I had a blast! Would definitely stay here again if I come back to Chicago soon. You won't regret it!
4395839	45335478	42248	40710388	Greg	It was really perfect. Damian and his roomates was welcoming, friendly, ... the room is exactly how we can imagine when we see pictures (a litle bit small sure, but confortable and cosy). It was a really good weekend. 
4395839	47900405	42268	16940365	Jacob	I had a great stay. Damian was extremely accommodating and super friendly - could have asked for a better experience. The room was as described and suited me quite well. Location wise the apartment is perfectly situated close to the 'Red' metro line that takes all over Chicago in no time.
7398946	40700558	42217	3798349	Madison	Tim was a great host, his place is very inviting and everything is there that you could want or need. He handed off the keys to me and showed me around the apartment. He also left me laundry detergent and quarters for the washer/dryer. His place is very clean and comfortable and its located in a nice building in a very good neighborhood. You can't argue with the price and you are getting an amazing value for your money  I would definitely stay there again if I return to Chicago. I highly recommend Tim's place!
7398946	41141341	42220	35103359	Cesar	Tim was great! He gave us the keys and showed us around and was very helpfull overall. His apartment was one room but exactly what we needed. Its also a great location!
7398946	42182741	42227	17059210	Patrick	Tim was a very fitting host for us in Chicago. Speedy response and a great pad to stay at while working and enjoying Chicago's finest attractions. We'll definitely keep him in mind for our next trip to the Chi!
7398946	44992662	42246	40802220	Maya	Tim's apartment was great. Looked just like the photos, a nice studio apartment right in the middle of Gold Coast/Old Town. Would definitely stay here again!
7398946	46199656	42255	4069160	Carlette	Overall a great apartment in a great neighborhood, we would recommend it! Ideal for a two people and we would stay again. This large studio is within walking distance of fantastic bars and restaurants, very close to the beach and great transport links for easy access to downtown.  We didn't get to meet Tim but his friend Virginia was available when we arrived to check us in and she was very helpful. Tim communicated well with us especially since we forgot our cell phone at the apartment and were able to return later with Virginia's help to look for it. 
7398946	47715977	42268	19597688	Javier	Tim was very quick to respond to my room request and to any follow-up questions. Additionally, he was very accommodating to my flight delay the night I was flying in. His apartment is in a great part of Chicago - very quiet and full of nice homes, also very close to the city - we walked into the city in no time at all.
268405	754608	40876	1417782	Julie	My boyfriend and I stayed in Kean's apartment for a weekend and loooved it!! Kean was very helpful with any tips or questions about our stay in Chicago for the first time. The apartment was a perfect location with a beautiful view on the top story and super convienent transportation right outside the door! We're eager to get back to Chicago asap!!!!! Kean was an amazing host!
268405	951440	40966	544046	Thandie	This is a great studio with a million dollar view!!! I walked in and it took my breathe away.  It is one of the penthouse apartments.  It was just me but it is also perfect for two people to stay with comfort.The location was also nice...it's only a 10min bus ride and you are in the middle of all the restaurants and entertainment you come ever want!!! I had a rental car and  it was plenty of parking anytime.Kean is a sweetheart and made sure I had everything I needed.  He is a wonderful host. I felt comfort and really at home. :0)Thanks Kean 
268405	2471620	41183	1776886	Johan-Till	Kean's place was great and exactly how he described it: clean and with a nice view. Would stay again.
268405	2538213	41190	3334074	Melissa	Wonderful place to stay! My husband got a short-notice deployment and we had one short window of time to make a trip to Chicago as a little last hurrah before he left the country. We were so glad we discovered airbnb and found Kean!  He welcomed us to organization, and was a great host. He was attentive and responsive when we had questions, provided recommendations for dinner, and was very accommodating. The condo was immaculate, very clean and comfortable. The building was easy to find, felt safe and secure, and Kean's directions were clear and helpful. The location is great and we loved the view from the balcony. When we felt like walking, we walked to Downtown, the Museum Campus and Soldier Field.  It's a couple miles but enjoyable. When we didn't feel like making the walk we hopped on the bus at the stop right outside the building and it was a short, simple ride straight up Michigan Ave to downtown. Cabs are also easy to hail on Michigan Ave. Overall we had a great stay, and would definitely stay here again. Thanks Kean for helping make a special trip so memorable for us!
268405	2579228	41193	2339934	Kevin	The only problem I had was with the bed.The view was incredible (east & downtown Chicago from the top floor). The room had everything I needed.  It was only a few minutes bus ride into downtown.  It was a safe, ideal location.  Kean met me at the apartment and showed me around.  He's a nice guy.  I had a few questions before I arrived and he answered every one of them right away.But the bed was very uncomfortable.  It is well used  and had a large divot in it.  So I resorted to the couch, which wasn't that much more comfortable, either.  Plus, although there was new washed pillow cases and base spread sheet, there was only a comforter to sleep under (no top sheet).  Now I may be wrong, but I would be surprised if the comforter was washed before each guest arrives (it would be quite expensive).  So, overall was a great stay, minus the bed.
268405	2692121	41204	3935403	Jacob	The reservation was canceled 34 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
268405	2749071	41211	3634088	Stefania	This Studio Condo was amazing. We had such a good time and the view was amazing. Everything is close form the studio and the bus stop to downtown is right outside the bulding. We would stay there again. Kean was really nice and helpful.It was a great experience and if I go to Chicago again, I will stay at Kean's place again.
268405	2852610	41223	4040978	Brian	This Studio Condo was great! Awesome view! WiFi and cable.
268405	3000729	41244	3690456	Magda	Great value for the price. The studio is centrally located near shopping, restaurants, Mc Cormik Place and major attractions; clean and comfortable with a small kitchen and bathroom. Awesome view, WiFi  ;)We would stay there again. Kean was really nice and helpful.
268405	3897608	41358	4586121	Kesha	I was in Chicago for a day, attending a lecture, and needed a nice, safe, and affordable place to stay. Found it at Keen's place. Very clean, secure building, GREAT VIEW. Instruction were clear, got in and out no problem.Would recommend or stay again.
268405	4239798	41385	5902801	Matt	"My first Airbnb experience, and this was a great start. Kean's place is spotless, roomy, with a great view- top floor- and a great location. Bus stop is right at the building, so it's easy to get downtown. Walk to McCormick Place. It's like a quiet hotel where they leave you alone, with free parking. At 1/3 the price!One place for improvement: It was very windy during my stay (no surprise for Chicago!), and the sliding door to the balcony was difficult to close completely, so it whistled. Either better instruction about how to close it, or some work on the sliding door track, would be appropriate.Kean responded quickly and positively to all my ""newbie"" questions and requests.Will definitely stay here again on my next trip to Chicago!"
268405	4301793	41390	5512492	Jose	Great value for the prize! Confortable accommodation, well communicated and Kean left everything set up for the my arrival, so I strongly recommend Kean's apartment for a short visit to Chicago. Not luxury but comfort. Jose 
268405	4360089	41394	5318363	Dave	I had a wonderful experience, staying at this studio apartment! I was in Chicago for a convention at McCormick Place, and this unit was better priced than any of the convention-sponsored hotels in the area. The apartment was clean, neat, well-stocked with towels & linens, and just a 15min walk from the convention center. And the view from the balcony was simply amazing! Kean was a gracious, communicative & accommodating host. This was my first time using Airbnb but, thanks to him, I doubt it will be my last! 
268405	4415872	41398	1122120	Satish	Kean had a great place in south loop. Impressive view of downtown from 21st floor. Away from hustle of downtown, but you can reach there in 10 min. by bus. All amenities required to make a comfortable stay are available in the accommodation. Thank you Kean. 
268405	4517284	41404	1590263	Alden	The apartment was just as described, and Kean was organized and responsive. This is a great option for someone attending a conference at McCormick Place, it's less than a mile walk to the conference center. There wasn't much in the immediate area as far as restaurants, bars, etc, but there is a supermarket within walking distance.
268405	4581232	41407	1827840	Carmen	Kean's condo was wonderful!!  It was neat, well equipped, and the view was spectacular! The condo overlooks the White Sox stadium and I was lucky enough to be there when they won, and had the unexpected surprise of seeing a great fireworks show!! It's  in the perfect location to explore the great sites of Chicago!  Kean was a pleasure to work with considering I bothered him more times than I had expected :)!  I'll definitely consider Kean's place first over all others the next time I need to stay in Chicago.
268405	4742596	41417	4158513	Keller	We stayed at Kean's place for a week and really enjoyed it. There's a wonderful view, great access to public transit, and Kean is very accommodating. Highly recommended.  
268405	4811582	41421	4331960	Toan	Great place !
268405	4965402	41429	5961114	Asma	We were in Chicago for a conference at McCormick Place and we chose this apartment because of it's proximity to the convention center. Kean was an excellent host, answering all our questions prior to the booking and travel and sending us detailed information about what to expect, which was all accurate. He was available 24/7 if we had any concerns, which we did not. The new couch (not pictured) is really great and comfy. I found the bed comfy as well, although it was too soft for my husband! The unit was clean and neat and since it's located on the top floor of the building the view and breeze were great! The location was a bit away from the restaurants and shops on Michigan Ave but for us this was not an issue since we had a rental car and free parking at the apartment. From other posts I think there is nearby bus access as well which goes to the magnificent mile. Overall we had a comfortable experience and were happy with our choice to stay here!
268405	5019639	41433	2090258	Niels	All Good! In walking distance to McCormick Place so the perfect place to stay when in town for a conference. Checking in & out is really easy and Kean is a good host.
268405	5038330	41434	2843879	Carlos	Beautiful apartment. Amazing view of Chicago and the South Side. Plenty big enough for two people. And for the price, it is GREAT! Thanks, Kean.
268405	5542279	41460	6417155	Dani	Great condo, beautiful view, and right in the area we wanted to be in. The only discrepancy was that it is listed as being 2 blocks from Mccormick place, but it is more like 1.5-2 miles, which would have been fine but had to bring a kid with and that was too far to walk. The space was very clean and tidy, and the building was nice and felt safe. We would stay here again in the future and recommend to friends. Kean was very quick with responses to my questions. 
268405	5884316	41476	6355493	Patrick	Kean is an excellent host, and this is a wonderful location. Access to public transportation makes exploring the city a great experience, and Kean's organized approach makes sure that you have everything you'll need to enjoy your stay.
268405	5923068	41477	7338383	Rory	Great experience!  Excellent studio apartment within reasonable walking distance to Soldier Field, Northerly Island, Shedd Aquarium.  Very nice view of downtown, and as a bonus, was right on the route of the Rock 'N Roll Chicago Half Marathon!  Communication was great, and everything was just as described.  Would stay again - thanks, Kean!
268405	6272054	41492	388476	Ross	Kean was an excellent host!    The unit was clean and the balcony was nice with a great view.  The bed could use updating.  I had a car during my stay so i can't rate the public transportation from the unit but it's about a 10 to 15 minute drive to downtown.   Parking is free and easy (just take note of the street cleaning hours) or just park in the spot at the South building.    Good spot if your traveling on a budget.     Again,  Kean was very polite and very responsive to all of my questions and needs.    I may return next year!
268405	6487076	41500	76316	Christian	My stay at Kean's apartment was globally fine. On the positive side, Kean provided me with all the neighborhood information I needed (he even drove me to the nearby supermarket), the apartment has everything you need (included air conditioning, good WiFi and cable TV with a large channel selection). The view from the balcony is stunning and the bus ride to downtown is about 15 mn. On the negative side, appliances are dated and it is noisy, but this goes with the height (21st floor) and the view!
268405	6666806	41506	7775989	Paul	For me it was all about the spectacular view (180-degres from the balcony) and very convenient  location. Bus #4 (right outside the back gate) will take you downtown in 15 minutes. Good and friendly neighborhood with lots of trees and nice landscaping. Building is very clean and secure (with security personnel on premisses). Great size apartment with everything that you might need on your trip. Kitchen is equipped with all necessary appliances, cutlery e.t.c.Pluming is a bit 'rusty' but it's a minor detail that does not take anything away from the overall expedience. If you can only sleep in absolute silence take ear plugs with you. You can hear the train from the distance. Once again not a major problem at all. I actually liked a little bit of that 'background noise'. When you are drinking coffee in the morning out on that 21th floor balcony you know you are in Chicago!!Kean is a great host. No nonsense guy always ready to help and answer your questions.Overall I had a great experience while on my one week vacation in this magnificent city.Don't hesitate. You have found the right place!  
268405	7620870	41544	7026105	Jason	When you open the door to Kean's condo the first thing that catches your attention is the incredible view.  Pictures just don't do it justice.  Inside the place is clean and comfortable.  The building grounds are well maintained and the other residents friendly.  Using the bus/rail is very easy and far less expensive and stressful than trying to park downtown.  The free parking is a huge bonus and money saver.  When you book with Kean he provides you a house manual that gives detailed instructions for check in/out, parking, transportation, etc.  This is tremendously helpful and I wish other airbnb hosts would adopt this practice.  Great stay and thank you for hosting me!
268405	7695134	41547	7065515	Michael	My first AirBnB experience was a pleasant one.  Kean's place is clean, cozy, and well-appointed.  My wife has limited mobility and the access was easy with minimal steps to and from the condo.   The balcony and view are fantastic- I could have stayed out there the whole weekend!  Neighbors are friendly and the neighborhood is clean and well-lit.  Only a few blocks from everything so a great location.  Kean's parking space is a half block away but there's a loading zone to make packing and unpacking easy.Only downside is that the bed is ideal for one, snug for two- with only one nightstand.  And the mattress is in need of retirement.  Other than that it was a very memorable weekend thanks to Kean's place.
268405	7800865	41550	269803	Lisa	I was in town for a trade show at McCormick.  I nice walk although probably should stick with a cab in that area.  Beautiful room and gorgeous views.  Great host!
268405	7841688	41552	1773014	Jason	It really is of the most amazing views of Chicago. Kean's house manual is well put together and there is a new/much large couch than the white one in the photo.I drove in so I really appreciated the parking spot. Kean was very responsive to the few questions I had. 
268405	7950328	41556	3114786	Colin	Condo is as described. Kean came by to say hello and gave us some information on the area and things to do in Chicago. Kean was very polite and the unit had everything you need. The view was amazing and you are only a 10 minute walk to the Green and Red lines on the subway, or you can take a bus downtown that will pick you up right in front of the building. Area is safe, walked home many times late at night from the subway with no issues. Parking was easy and safe as well. Thanks for everything Kean.
268405	8077815	41562	6678961	Annie	I had an remarkable stay in Chicago.  Kean's place definitely made my trip to Chicago worthwhile.  I loved the place.  The view of the city was breathtaking from the balcony, the place itself was very tidy, and most of all, the host (Kean) was very accommodating and helpful when I had questions.  It was my first time in Chicago and being able to stay at such a beautiful place made my trip much more enjoyable.  It was easy to get into downtown from the studio as there were bus stops right in front of the building.  Overall, I would definitely recommend staying at this studio if you love having a view of the city throughout the day and night.  I would definitely stay here again if I go back to Chicago in the near future.
268405	8324282	41573	6155582	Sean	Kean's place was great. Excellent view from the top floor with nothing blocking the view! Stay there!
268405	8640181	41588	1288355	Eric	This condo is as advertised. Kean was extremely responsive. He came by the first day and introduced himself and answered all my questions. This was a business trip for me and I spent a lot of time at MacCormick Center and the Hyatt as well as downtown. The public bus right out front on Michigan Avenue is convenient and frequent and for $2.25 per trip, inexpensive. I also used taxis which were not a problem on weekday mornings. The neighborhood is safe. The price of the condo reflects the location on the south side. All is neat and clean, but do not expect walkable nearby restaurants or similar amenities. This is a quiet and clean place to sleep that works for a person attending a convention, as I did, or for a visitor to Chicago that wants some relief from the activity of downtown. There is an beautiful view from the large balcony as a bonus with this top floor unit.
268405	8906804	41603	4705185	Julia	"DANGEROUS LOCATION and RUDE, DISMISSIVE HOST!Women: Save your money and stay closer to the city center. The money you spend on cabs to safely access safe neighborhoods will negate anything you save staying here. I booked this apartment for my very first visit to Chicago, so did not know the neighborhoods. I saw good reviews, so assumed it was safe. Not so!  The apartment says ""South Loop"" but that's an exaggeration. This is a really bad area--full blown South Chicago. Within hours of arriving I was instructed to never be outdoors past nightfall and to be extremely cautious even in daylight hours. When I expressed my concerns to Kean and suggested leaving, he was extremely rude, dismissive, and wholly unhelpful. Even if he didn't agree with me, he could have offered reassurance. Instead, he basically told me I was fabricating the entire situation. There was no conversation -- his answer was just a firm and nonnegotiable no, you're crazy, no. No help, no refunds, no concern that his guest was frightened. The money was already in his pocket so I stayed, but being here really, really put a damper on my trip.Pros: Spotlessly clean apartment. Very comfortable. Full working kitchen. If you're a tough man or need someplace near Mercy Hospital, then this is a lovely place to stay.Cons: Noise! The sound of sirens--ambulances to and from the hospital, and police around the neighborhood--woke me every night. The blinds on the windows are also ineffective, and the apartment stays brightly lit even with the lights off. Unsafe (see discussion above).Note: I am a 23 year-old female. This would probably be a safe space for a man, but women take caution."
268405	9074127	41612	10090924	Abdulrahman	I would like to give my full pleasure to mr.kean for his  great efforts to make me comfortable during my 5 days staying in his condo which was great place for me since it is walk distance from MCcormick place while attending  radiology symposium . Really i recommend Kean's condo for those who attending activities in McCormick place and for those who looking for quite place to stay . Again thank you Kean So much!!!!!!!!!! 
268405	12657144	41766	11518012	Dirk J	-
268405	13182141	41780	12760608	Carolina	Kean's apartment was just as described, the new sofa (picture not shown) is great. The view is very pretty, especially at sunset when it is amazingly unbelievable!!! Beautiful sunset will recommend to watch it  at least once during your stay.The neighborhood is very nice and also it is a little noisy, but as it says in the description it is because is a busy neighborhood in the city. If you are going to a conference or Show at Mc Cormick Place, this is the perfect location for you, it is 100% walking distance and safe. I did not get to use the kitchen (because I was at a Restaurant Show) and with so many options to dine in this wonderful city I did not get the chance to do any cooking, but the kitchen seemed perfectly clean and with all necessary appliances.The apartment is close to everything, less that 10 min you are in the heart of the city. Everything is very clean and comfortable. Definately a place to recomend to stay in Chicago !!! Kean and I did not meet because he was out of town, but he responded to all my questions in real time. I felt very safe in the bouilding and around it as well. Taxis take only like 5 min to get there once you call them.Great location VERY recommended. THANK YOU KEAN !!!!! 
268405	13477100	41787	14129036	Lisandro	The apartment was exactly as advertised. It was also clean. The location is convenient and safe. The view from the balcony is great. Check-in and check out were very easy, and Kean responded promptly to all questions and requests.  
268405	13954036	41799	2419521	Kristian	We enjoyed staying at Kean's place. Getting in and out was painless, the place has a terrific view, and overall it's a very comfortable apartment. Recommended!
268405	14687031	41814	7597316	Bruno	Ideal flat next to the mc Cormick center. Bus nÂ° 4 is just at your feet if you want to visit downtown Chicago. Great quality/price ratio. Kean is a nice fellow who is concerned, even if you've mistaken your reservations dates ;)
268405	14911763	41819	3723274	Kathy	Kean seemed really, really nice, and all the people in the building that I encountered were friendly. However, I would not recommend this condo. It smelled bad, partly because the place has terrible air circulation. The bed sheets seemed worn and old. The bed pillows did not look like the picture in the listing. There were two flat, smelly pillows that should have been thrown away. I covered them with towels just to make it through the few days I was there. The carpeting was old and frayed. The bathroom sink was cracked. Slats were missing from the vertical blinds. The listing said it was 2 1/2 blocks to McCormick Center. In fact, it was a mile. The neighborhood has nothing to offer. One of my taxi drivers said I should be OK walking to the bus during the daytime, but he would not recommend walking at night. I am seriously reconsidering ever renting through Airbnb again. My last rental was awesome. This was the opposite. It's really too risky for me.
268405	15690173	41834	16300326	Jeff	Kean was a great host with quick and clear communication.  The condo was  as described and close to the convention center for my activities.  The price was great  and allowed me to save $ since I only needed a place to sleep.You can quickly and easily pick up buses or taxis right outside the building.Thanks for the use!
268405	16109130	41842	16904105	Mike	I stayed at Kean's South Michigan location for three nights and the entire experience was great.  Before arrival, Kean was very quick to respond to any questions I may have had.  The apartment was exactly as described.  Everything was very clean and exceeded my expectations.  The location was great for what I needed - it's very close to downtown and the view is incredible.  Kean could not have made this process any easier.  I would definitely recommend Kean and this location specifically. 
268405	16413635	41847	9213797	Kayla	Kean's condo was a great place for our stay. We were attending a concert at Soldier's Field an it was just a $5 uber ride from the condo. Just blocks away from downtown and a great view. The condo was clean and the bed was super comfy :) A great affordable stay if you don't mind not being in the heart of downtown or have a need for things to do right outside of where you are staying. We took cabs downtown and drove to the far north side to experience boutique shopping and breakfast in Lakeview, Lincoln Park and Old Towne, all about a 20-30 minute drive. Would definitely stay here again!
268405	16777310	41853	6970085	Richard	Good place. Handy for my visit to McCormick place, within walking distance. Clean and comfortable. Recommended...
268405	17025094	41856	19138028	Finbarr	The studio was great. Very clean and spacious.  Close to down town. Would definitely recommend.
268405	19076687	41888	18194157	Shengying	This was my first Airbnb reservation, and my host Kean has done everything to ensure it to be a wonderful experience. I arrived late in the evening, and it was very kind of him to wait for me and welcome me to the place. The studio is as described. In fact, the description is very humble... The studio is spacious, and is equipped with everything you need during your stay. You have a superb view from the balcony. The building and area is very safe, and there is an on-site laundry room. Location is just perfect, and the price is hard to beat. Running to the lake and north up to Field Museum was such an enjoyment. Transportation is not limited to bus right downstairs, but also a Divvy bike station around the corner.  In short, Kean is an awesome host and this accommodation will exceed your expectation.
268405	20646797	41915	19311505	David	This was a great airBnB experience! I stayed at Kean's studio for a conference at the Hyatt Regency, which was a convenient 15 minute walk. The studio was as described, and Kean left very clear instructions for getting into the building/studio and checking out. The neighborhood felt safe, and the building is very secure (gated and surveillance monitored). The only issue I had was at checkout, during which the house cleaner arrived early (due to a mixup with the checkout time) and had to start cleaning while I was packing up. 
268405	20758886	41917	20132357	Evan	Kean's place is great! I used to live in Chicago so know the city fairly well, and knew that despite some of the reviews on here, that Bronzeville (especially so close to the lake and a gigantic city park) is not a bad neighborhood. Only downside I would say is that there is not very much to do within walking distance. However, very easy train access and very close to the highway if you are traveling with a vehicle. The apartment itself was very clean when we arrived, towels laid out for us, everything exactly as described by Kean himself. The house manual he provided was simple, straightforward and generous. Two weekend nights were well worth it for the price he was asking, as many decent hotels in the area were charging double. Would stay again!
268405	21000541	41921	2419537	Michael	It was a nice apartment with an amazing view as others described (probably the best feature of the apartment).  I stayed here because it was close to the convention center but probably would not stay in this area if I was coming to Chicago as a tourist.  Neighborhood is extremely quiet (there are no restaurants or shops) and it seems safe and pleasant (I saw rabbits hopping around while walking to the convention center).  Kean was relatively responsive but didn't respond a couple of times when I was close to moving in.  There is no ironing board in the apartment but he does have an iron.  The blinds are missing a few leaves but it kept out most of the light.  The bed and couch were comfortable as well as the rest of the apartment.  If I had a reason to go to the convention center I would definitely stay here.  It's great to come back after a long day and see that view.
268405	21889819	41938	13237643	Veronika	We did enjoy our staying at the apartment! There is everything you need, kitchen is well equipped, plenty of towels, pillows etc. The spot is perfect for max. 4 people. Kean was very nice and easygoing host, trying to meet all our needs. He responds immediately. And the view is amazing!!!
268405	22096420	41942	17372904	Dayle	Kean was very responsive and answered all emails right away. The set up was just as he described and as other reviewers have put forth. The view is tremendous, the building is in a quiet safe neighborhood. I walked to the convention center every day and up to the Hilton area as well. I did take a taxi home in the evening. That ran about $7.50. 
268405	22230692	41945	2971341	Sara	His place was very clean, clean building. Top floor -- very nice view. The building was very easy to get to. It was located right on Michigan Ave which was a benefit. The only negative thing I would say about the location is that nothing is within walking distance. So you must drive or take a cab if you want to see what Chicago has to offer. Other than that, I would recommend it. 
268405	22378664	41947	195588	Janie	Everything was great! Kean responded very quickly to emails/texts. Thanks. 
268405	22598447	41953	15262858	Pauline	Unfortunately it was not a good experience, we had in Keans apartment. The place itself is totally ok, but for tourists not well located. There is nothing around, not even a supermarket and so you have to take the bus to go to anything interesting. But it was described, so that was not a problem at all. Kean seems to be a nice guy, even if we never met him in Person, because he left the keys on the nightstand and the door open to get in.Until this point it was very uncomplicated and when we arrived, we met his cleaninglady, who told us, until 5pm there will be no water in the apartment because there are works on the pipes. No problem for us, how should he have known, when we booked the flat...But on the next day the water still wasn't running over the day and we couldn't use the toilet or the shower at all. In the evening the water was running again, but the toilet didn't work and seemed to be broken. We told Kean, so he could fix it and he sent someone who came on the next day. In the evening the toilet was fixed, but the first three days we went without a working bathroom, which was not very comfortable.The other problem was, that the apartment smelled like gas. The guy who fixed the toilet explained to us, that the little flames in the stove weren't high enough and were blown out from the wind, because the balcony-door wasn't closing very well (another point, that was not very comfy). So it smelled like gas, but we weren't endangered on any time.Kean offered us, to refund some money for the troubles, and so asked airbnb, how much he should give us. The airbnb-workers were very nice and concerned about the gas- and the toilet-problem. They told us, it would be fair, if Kean would refund us the first 3 days, because a working toilet needs to be in an apartment. They even gave us some new addresses in Chicago for much more expensive and central located flats to stay (they would have payed the difference).We made the mistake and didn't move, because we thought, it wouldn't be fair for Kean. He would have to pay back more money for the last days and at least, he tried to fix everything.Unfortunately he just refunded us a little money and not the value airbnb suggested. And he was very unreasonable about that. Anyway, airbnb did a great job, stayed in contact with us and Kean and reacted very fast and uncomplicated. They really take care about their guests. But if you have troubles with an apt. you should definitely move to another as fast as possible. Than there would be no discussion about the refund.
268405	22977541	41962	5315617	Marios	My stay at Kean's place was what I expected based on the number of previous reviews, location and pictures. It's definitely value for money, although it is true as others have pointed out that the general neighborhood is a bit empty, nothing to really see or do there. Downtown is close though. I chose the place mainly because of the proximity to McCormick Place, but it was so cold outside during my visit that I considered a cab just for the 5 blocks walk.The flat itself is spacious and clean and the kitchen is well-equipped. I didn't actually meet Kean but he was available via iMessage and readily responded to my queries. 
268405	23458613	41974	23590626	Boris	Everything was excellent, thank you.
268405	24102586	41993	4123717	Zak	I was in town for a conference at the McCormick center. This place was perfect. It is a short walk to the center but since I was here in December I usually just hopped in the bus and was usually walking into the convention center less than 10 minutes after I left the apartment. This apartment has everything you need, is easy to access from public transportation and was perfect for met. I'd stay here again.
268405	27506248	42069	27753018	Patrycja	I cannot say it was horrible and that I wouldn't recommend others to stay because that would be unfair, as it had its positives and adequacy. That being said, I do not think that it was as described. For example, one of the biggest negatives and perhaps only true negative was that the owner describes having a hired help clean the Apartment. However, I found the place to be not the cleanest, especially if there is hired help... i recommend that the owner hire someone else because they might be completely duping you. I ended up sleeping on the couch on the only clean looking blanket Just to be safe. This was not ideal or super comfy. There was hair in the floor of bathroom as well . A few other minor problems were immediately dealt with because kean is available 24/7 as he states on his page, which is extremely generous and convenient. I do think the price is higher than the quality of stay; however, you do get the whole place to yourself, which is nice. 
268405	27937977	42078	12166648	Morgan	Kean was very helpful and responded immediately to any questions we had. The condo is about a 10 minute walk from McCormick Place and 20 minutes from down town. The bus also stops out front, which was very handy. The condo itself had everything we needed - a comfortable bed and air mattress, kitchen, etc. It is a little run down but the furnishings are updated and Kean has obviously made an effort to make it look nice. The condo was relatively clean but could use a deep cleaning. The sheets and bathroom were clean. It was a convenient and comfortable place for us to stay! Also, the view is fantastic. 
268405	28434177	42086	1204375	Joan	Kean's place was in the perfect location for our event at the McCormick. Kean was very quick to reply to any questions I had and was very friendly.  There were three of us staying at his studio which is basically an old hotel building, the appt is exactly like staying in a lived in hotel room. The balcony was the best part, it had an amazing view and was wonderful to step out to get some fresh air, because the studio was about 80 degrees the whole time we were there. We had to sleep with the door open both nights to sleep, but pretended we were on vacation somewhere warm. We felt very safe and getting in and out of the building was very easy. It was also a very quiet building, which we also loved. Staying in Kean's studio you will have easy, free street parking if you drive and getting a cab on Michigan is very easy too. There are no restaurants or grocery stores near by which I read in the previous reviews, so I stopped for a few groceries before coming. I wish I would have bought toilet paper, because there was less than one roll for three girls to share. There was also suppose to be two air mattresses, but there was one. The couch is a sectional and can sleep two (not that comfy)and the bed (sort of comfy) is a queen that can sleep two as well. The listing says up to five people, but I don't see that happening unless you want to be packed in like sardines. Overall, I would recommend staying here, but know it's not fancy, it looks better in the pictures. If it were a hotel it would be about a 2 star. The three of us would stay again for sure because of the convenience and price. 
268405	28550775	42088	25584077	James	A last minute decision to attend a trade show in Chicago led me to booking this apartment with Kean.  He was very responsive to our communications and I was quickly able to secure his apartment the same day I was to arrive.  Kean was very accommodating and was able to arrange the cleaning of his flat inside the small timeframe between the previous guest's departure and my arrival.The apartment was quite clean and comfortable.  It's a bachelor apartment, which wasn't apparent by the photos, but I was on my own this trip so I didn't require more space.The location of the apartment is not ideal for walking anywhere for restaurants or shopping.  You definitely need a car or public transit to get to the downtown core.  This didn't bother me since I had a car and it was close enough to the McCormick Center.  I attempted to walk it the first morning but the sidewalks were  not well cleared.Overall, I found it to be good value if you are attending a trade show or need to be near IIT, but if I come back to Chicago for pleasure I will book something closer to the downtown core.
268405	30678706	42120	15829252	Tim	The apartment was great! Exactly what we needed, and very clean. My friends and I felt very comfortable staying here. Street parking was effortless and I was able to find a spot very close to the apartment. We had no issues with noise or rowdy neighbors. The walk from the apartment to the McCormick Center was very easy and enjoyable as the weather was very nice.
268405	32134858	42138	15516668	Alicia	Chris was very accommodating and facilitated my ability to have groceries delivered. Some reviews mention that there is little within walking distance, and this is true, but Peapod delivery was amazing and I was even able to get a bottle of wine delivered one evening from Burnham Liquors (listed on Drinkfly.) The place is compact but private, efficient, and comfortable. I was there overseeing an event at the McCormick and would say the walk is closer to 15 minutes to the hotel side, so I was having Uber pick me up early morning and the cost ranged from $4-6 to and from the venue. Overall it was a great experience and I'd recommend for someone attending or working an event nearby.
268405	33014802	42148	23452788	Tara	This was our first experience with booking AirBNB.  Christopher made it easy, pleasant, was very accommodating and readily available by phone, text or email to answer our questions.  The apartment was just perfect for our needs and the location was great for parking and public transportation was literally steps away.   I agree with many of the other reviews, the bed and sofa where quite comfortable, linens clean and good quality, full size refrigerator was great for leftover from all the great restaurants we went to and allowing for breakfast-in and on our time schedule.  It was a nice touch to have an almost eyelevel view of the fireworks from the 21st floor exploding at the stadium.  Thanks for arranging that Christopher! :-) 
268405	34261826	42161	31914506	Stephanie	It was a quick short stay, we didn't arrive until late and left pretty early. We were there for a work training event so if we wouldn't have been able to connect to a different free wifi that would have made the trip very difficult.
268405	34437640	42163	7197877	Patrick Henry	Christopher's directions for getting to and into the apartment were clear and accurate. The internet access wasn't working properly when we arrived and he responded promptly to our call and helped us get it working again very quickly. The apartment is easy walking distance (1.2 miles) to US Cellular Field and the baseball game we came to see. About the same distance along Michigan Avenue to many great Chicago sites. The apartment is quite small; no space for 2 people to sit down and eat. Seems a bit overpriced for the space. 
268405	35281243	42171	772783	Ben	While I didn't have the opportunity to actually meet Christopher, he was a very hospitable host. I booked my reservation at the last-minute yet he still willingly accommodated me. Christopher was generous enough to provide me with a refund when I informed him that his apartment wasn't clean when I arrived. He took full responsibility for the state of his listing, even though his cleaning staff made a mistake by cleaning the wrong place. I highly recommend staying at Christopher's place! It is comfortable and it affords a nice view of the city from the top balcony. 
268405	35563583	42175	2549807	Henry	Christopher was a great host. Instructions were clear so check-in and check-out was quite easy. Everything was in clean condition and it was a good place to stay for conference at nearby McCormick Place.
268405	36256175	42182	6661418	Mike	Everything was great. The place was clean and Kean was on top of everything. 
268405	37720324	42194	37718817	John	Christopher is a great host. I had a really late flight and he was super flexible with my itinerary. It's a great spot close to downtown with an awesome balcony with an amazing view of downtown. Very comfortable place, highly recommend! 
268405	38812117	42204	55471	Jessica	Had a great time. It was an excellent location and the area/building felt very safe!
268405	39241503	42206	23168585	Brian	Easy check in/out. The view is absolutely amazing. Great location. Close to the city and night life. 
268405	40896127	42219	953034	Yadira	The apartment was amazing . A wonderful view and a comfy bed. The Netflix was awesome as well. Very secure and safe location. Would love to stay again. Very accommodating of a 1am arrival and always available if needed.
268405	41301856	42221	32927956	Chris	Beautiful view, good location
268405	42237501	42227	1313522	Marcus	Where should I start? Christopher was such an amazing host. He was very accommodating with our last minute booking. The place was very clean and neat, with an inviting fresh scent of fragrance that lit up the room. The place overall was very comfortable. The view was spectacular! My wife and I sat for hours watching the skyline! It was so refreshing! The building was very well kept and modern. Parking was hassle free. Christopher checked on after we checked out to reassure we were satisfied with our stay. I travel to Chicago monthly, and I plan on making Christopher's place my new home away from home when I visit. Thanks Christopher! You rock! 
268405	42500831	42229	27379635	Zi	Acceptable. No lamp no curtain

268405	44806663	42245	1105094	Jeremy	The place was just as described and the view is amazing. The public transportation was easy to find and the bus literally drops off in front of the building. 
268405	46879597	42261	5363414	Jonah	If you're looking for a value option, this is it. But you get what you pay for. The apartment is not in great overall shape. It's not unclean, just beat up. The vertical blinds in the main photo don't exist, which leaves a ton of light coming straight into the bedroom. The view is nice and high, but 30,000 city lights coming through the floor to ceiling, wall to wall glass made it very hard for me to get good sleep for the 4 nights I was there. I called the host the first night about the blinds and he said something along the lines of 'I liked the view so I never got blinds.' To each, his own, I guess. But seeing blinds in the photo makes me feel lied to. At some point there were blinds, they probably broke, and then the host gave me a less irresponsible sounding excuse. Whatever. There's also no XBOX360 (also in the photo) but that doesn't bother me. Other stuff that was broken: the fridge didn't get cold and the ice bin was filled was water. The Apple TV remote was missing, leaving the TV unusable.  I didn't really care about either of these things, but other guests might. I told the host, so maybe they'll be fixed for your stay. To be fair, the host was polite, responsive, and I had no trouble accessing the unit. That counts for something. Overall I would not recommend staying here and next time I visit Chicago I will definitely stay elsewhere. But if you're on a really tight budget, it's passable.
268405	47353480	42265	3714439	Jason	The apartment is located in a good place to public transport. There is limited places to eat, etc surrounding, but only a bus ride away. Apartment was fairly clean. Ready to go when I arrived. Beautiful view of downtown from this 21st floor. Major problem was that the fridge didn't work. At all. I let the host know on the first day and nothing happened to fix it/check it. Disappointing because the reason I rented the apartment over a hotel was so that I could cook food/have a fridge. 
268405	47674347	42268	39328405	Victoria	This space did the job as far as it was a place to stay relatively close to the city for a night, it was easy to get in to, and we could park close by for free.The cleaning checklist said that everything was clean, including the fridge, however the fridge had literally the WORST smell I have ever smelled in my life. We had to open the patio doors to air out the space after we cracked the fridge once.  The fridge also didn't even function, as a soda we stuck in there overnight wasn't cold by morning (we had to subject ourselves to the nasty smell again for nothing). The TV did not work, there was no remote for the Apple TV so we weren't able to watch anything at all. There were no blinds on the patio door, leaving the setting sun to blind us/make the room hot. Other than all these things, it was an okay place to stay. I would not stay here again, though. 
2954956	13120101	41778	238172	Dawn	Christina's house was in a great location near a 24 hour drugstore and an internet coffee house. I walked all around Ukrainian Village and over to Wicker Park and back. There was so much to see and do and eat and drink! My stay was short but she was a very welcoming hostess. She easily accommodated my unconventional early arrival time and didn't mind at all that I came and went well into the wee hours. 
2954956	16048068	41840	3374779	Nii	Christina's place was lovely. Tucked away in a friendly residential neighborhood with lots of green and shade, it was a nice place to take a walk. Her two dogs were uber friendly and Christiana herself was the warmest of hosts, seeing to her guests needs and engaging in pleasant conversation. I would recommend this place to any of my friends.
2954956	16192572	41842	10538365	Rembert	The best Airbnb stay I've had. Christina could not have been nicer, more accomodating, and understanding of my very last minute arrangement. Highly recommend it, would strongly consider again next time I'm in the Chicago area. 
2954956	16440108	41847	18608687	Dan	Christina and the dogs were great.  They were welcoming and the room was exactly what I needed for a quick weekend in the city.  The area was neat and close enough to make the main tourist attractions easily accessible.

2954956	16638527	41850	1463040	Peter	Christina is a personable and helpful host, and her dogs are friendly and sweet. Her place is full of character - recommended.
2954956	18046563	41871	16335550	Mike	Christina was very accommodating considering that I had a last minute reservation. She had a reply within twenty minutes after sending. Her location was convenient considering the timing. 
2954956	18681458	41881	20013844	Ryan	Christina's place was very nice. Her dogs were friendly, and so was she. I really enjoyed the tea she prepared for me, and she was very kind and considerate towards me. I would definitely recommend her as a host.
2954956	18767841	41882	15853405	Anwar And Jessica	I feel Christina's place could have been better.  It was very got in the room and the place had no ac.   Also the dogs were always barking and very loud. 
2954956	19174074	41889	20848064	Susan	I arrived late and although I only chatted with Christina for. Few moments she was very pleasant.  The apt. was in a quiet neighborhood, easy to find and easy to walk to coffee shops etc.Unfortunately due to my allergies and the weather (heat) during my visit to Chicago I was unable to stay for the duration of my reservation.  Christina graciously refunded me for the two additional nights I had originally booked.  Her apt./room would be more suitable during cooler temperatures for me.
2954956	19352350	41892	9063419	Bruno	how better to be greeted by two tail wagging 'guards', getting 'checked out' and approved by the amount of cuddles they receive ;-)very easy and accomodating stay inmidst of the ukrainian village. easy access straight  into downtown by bus 66 and 35min to/from o'hare via blue line and bus 49.christina was very hospitable and so were her two dogs, barking nevertheless but meaning no harm, just asking for cuddles.reservation request was immediately answered and separate bedroom as described.would stay again.
2954956	19612475	41897	19538052	Oliver	Stating with Christina was great. She accommodated my late in the day arrival with grace and ease and made me feel at home from the minute I arrived. Her dogs were sweet and the room was perfect for my needs and exactly as described. 
2954956	22697483	41955	1124322	Sterling	Living with Tina was simply a delight. She's so kind, caring, and gives you the personal space you need. I really enjoyed chatting with her and spending time (website hidden) and Bandit! The area is very safe, and it's right by the 77 bus and close to the blue line. For the price, you can't get much better.
2954956	22729004	41955	5455629	Alex	The reservation was canceled the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2954956	28596373	42090	24244664	Phuong	I stayed with Tina for more than 3 months. Tina was certainly very welcoming and she went the extra length to make sure I have the most comfortable stay possible. The dogs were friendly once they get to know me. The location is safe, transportation to downtown is convenient. Highly recommended!
2954956	31620900	42131	1349586	Alex	I had a wonderful stay at Christina's home. It is very well located in close walking distance to many nice restaurants and public transport. If you want to have a great stay in Chicago - I would highly recommend you stay with Christina!

2954956	33651730	42155	27941499	Ellie	Four of the house's five locks were broken or keyless, meaning the house could be entered at any time. I contacted Airbnb after Christina repeatedly failed to meet agreed deadlines have them repaired. Airbnb determined that the property was unsafe and helped me find alternative accommodation within 24 hours.

2954956	35918906	42178	30966823	Zachary	Christina was very welcoming and her dogs are very cute. The neighborhood is safe and located near many urban amenities, but not so close that it's busy and noisy.
2954956	43350988	42235	11598100	Hannes	Christina and her lovely dogs Dodsy and Bandit were perfect hosts altogether. I was able to use all the amenities as mentioned beforehand and never had any problems with Christina, my room or anything else during my stay. The Ukrainian village is a safe and laid back community which still has all the bars, restaurants and grocery stores you might need in walking distance.

5847065	31275320	42127	18394922	Katie	We had a nice stay at Greg's place! A friend and I had our first airbnb experience here. Greg welcomed us to check in as so as our flight got in (we were at his place around 5:30 am!). He offered breakfast in the morning when we checked out and provided fresh coffee (which was much needed after having been awake for nearly 24 hours the day before). The two rooms were spacious, the place is decorated nicely, and the price is unbeatable! The location is perfect as well. Can't beat it for a first time trip to Chicago! 
5847065	31988181	42136	10299342	Michele	I reserved this spot for a colleague and he had nothing but great things to say! Host was responsive, place clean and welcoming. Would stay again! Thank you for making this a good experience. 
5847065	32208553	42139	1946189	Mary	This is a great location in one of Chicago's truly wonderful neighborhoods with a lot going on etc.  Greg was very hospitable, makes you feel at home and is available if you need anything.  
5847065	32221129	42139	33233999	Brandon	I felt very welcome and Greg was accommodating.
5847065	32403384	42141	28402881	Valerie	Greg made our Chicago stay easy and fun!  GREAT LOCATION, GREAT BREAKFAST, AND FRIENDLY HOST!  We would stay again if in the area! 
5847065	32781692	42145	32874744	Maureen	Greg was very welcoming and the neighborhood was awesome. So many cool restaurants and stores nearby. The apartment itself was clean and spacious. The only thing that wasn't super was the bed, which sags in the lower half, but that wasn't a huge deal. I'd definitely stay here again. 
5847065	33715910	42155	33297372	Matthew	Perfect place to crash, awesome neighborhood and a great host. Chill as can be. 
5847065	33961212	42157	5100893	Brooke	Greg is easy going. His space is tidy and private. Unfortunately we were only in Chicago for a day and a night. Lincoln Park is super cool and we can't wait to go back! 
5847065	34032608	42158	33697137	Jackie	We stayed at Greg's home the next to last night of an 8 day roadtrip where we only stayed at airbnb's.  Greg (and his dog) were welcoming and very accommodating.  The location was wonderful.  I did feel that it was a little expensive in comparison to other places that we stayed when making a comparison of the sleeping quarters themselves.  Though Greg did try to make the rooms look nice it is a basement in an older building.  The beds were also not very comfortable.  It is a great place to stay if you want to enjoy all that Lincoln Park has to offer but may not be the best choice for a more discriminating traveler.
5847065	34473632	42163	14137315	Bryce	Greg was great! Check-in was extremely easy, and his place is in one of the best areas of town. There's plenty of shopping and food within minutes of the house. Also, can't beat that the metro into downtown is only 1/2 a block away. If you're planning to use the futon for a bed, note that it's not the most comfortable thing in the world -- A few glasses of wine later though, and I slept fine. 
5847065	34823789	42167	34992588	Alex	This was our first airbnb experience.  Greg was very welcoming, laid back, and friendly.  His apartment is in a great location (just off the Brown Line, walking distance to a ton of stuff, safe neighborhood, etc).  The rooms were in the basement which offered privacy.  We were only there for one night but enjoyed our stay!
5847065	35224472	42171	12506108	Harrison	Overall very pleasant experience. Greg is a very nice guy and is happy to chat about what to see and where to eat in Chicago. The place is pretty bare-bones, but there are two separate bedrooms downstairs with private bathroom, so there's a lot of privacy, and it feels like you have your own apartment. The location is excellent too--easy access to transit and a ton of great amenities within walking distance. One issue is that the place could've been a bit cleaner, but for the price and the size of the space it was still a great setup. Thanks Greg!
5847065	35438083	42173	33953317	Paul	Great neighborhood, very comfortable place, super cool host! A+ all around. Thanks Greg!
5847065	36805387	42186	21923711	Monica	You can't go wrong staying at Greg's. It was my first time visiting Chicago and I had an excellent time, thanks in part to Greg's hospitality, laid-back attitude, and sympathy. His place is charming and the accommodations in the basement are straightforward, just like in the pictures. Greg prepared tasty and sumptuous breakfast for us every morning--I'm still savoring his pumpkin pancakes and the cheese omelette. During breakfast, my friend and I enjoyed chatting with Greg about places to visit downtown, Chicago's incredible public art, local restaurants, Greg's growing herb garden, and his friendly dogs Lola and Ray Charles. His neighborhood, Lincoln Park, is extremely charming, and just a mile away from Lake Michigan. My friend and I jogged every morning to the lake, passing through the free and well-kept Lincoln Park Zoo. I also enjoyed the easiness of using public transportation, the Brown Line is a block away from Greg's house. In 10-15 mins you are in Millennium Park, ready to stroll downtown. Greg--Julia and I are very happy to have stayed at your place. Thanks for hosting us!!
5847065	37463499	42192	23076331	David	What a treat to stay with Greg.  The condo is convenient to public transportation, just a block from the elevated train.  Took us 15-20 minutes to get into the city.  There were two bedrooms in the basement, comfortable mattresses.  Hearty breakfast and great conversation was the perfect way to start the day.  Greg had helpful suggestions for activities, restaurants and how to get around.  Walked with my son to the Lincoln Park Zoo about a mile away.  Can't wait to stay there again. 
5847065	38360817	42199	13959300	Carter	We made this booking last minute to stay in while my husband and his dad moved us into our new apartment in Lincoln Park. He was very quick to get back to us and it was a great location. However, this place is mot well suited for college students etc. There was one bottom sheet on the bed with a thin blanket. The mattresses really really thin and uncomfortable. The shower was not clean or well maintained. Overall it was a place to crash and that was it. I would not stay here again. I'm sure he is a nice guy, but the room was not nice or well maintained. 
5847065	39194742	42206	14118290	Gabriel	Greg was great, the neighbourhood is very nice. The place was dirty, the bathroom was not clean. Kinda like a College dorm room.
5847065	39283476	42207	32967880	Monica	Greg is very personable and pleasant.  We met him before lunch to drop off our bags early.  The neighborhood and room accommodations were as described.  I contacted him a few times via text regarding the internet and our departure plans.  He responded quickly and was very helpful.
5847065	39574635	42209	16245503	Jamie	The house locates in a very nice neighborhood, and very close to the metro station. The basement is cozy with privacy. We enjoyed our 2-day stay very much. Greg also cooked delicious breakfast for us, which is much appreciated. We will surely come back when we visit Chicago next time!
5847065	40348400	42215	36812603	Kendra	Had a great stay in Chicago.  Rooms were as described, a little worn as you'd expect in an old home, but perfectly comfortable and well worth the price.  The location was wonderful - only a minute or two walk to the train station and from there straight down to the Loop to see downtown Chicago.  Plenty of restaurants/coffee shops/drug stores in the area and we never felt unsafe walking.  Greg as a great host, he gave us some good tips on what to do and how to get there (the 606 Trail is a must if you want to head out to see Bucktown and Wicker Park neighborhoods!) And of course I can't forget the breakfasts in the mornings - really good and just as good if not better than what you'd find at a pricey brunch place.  
5847065	45129467	42247	40033126	Le	Greg,the host who is nice and helpful. We love his pancake and the neighborhoods are wonderful,(website hidden) is easy to get to the subway. For the stay place, I have to say it is not clean and the facility in the washroom is some kind of broken.
5847065	45192311	42247	41761001	Jerry	The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
5847065	45591652	42251	29926456	Marc	Awesome, what a great experience. The accomadation was just as described and very comfortable. Greg was a super nice guy and host. Very easy to talk to and very friendly. The location couldn't have been better. A very cool, happening neghborhood with lots to do. Wrigley Field was just a short walk up the street. Whenever I'm in Chicago, I'll be staying here.
5847065	46004743	42254	3441801	Leah	Thoroughly enjoyed our overnight.  Great part of town, and great breakfast, thank you
5847065	46253092	42255	13976392	Pat	This is a great bargain! It's nothing fancy but had a comfortable bed and bathroom, and it's in a great location surrounded by tons of shops, bars, and restaurants. Plus breakfast is included! 
5847065	47094634	42262	42236383	Tom	Greg's a great guy. He was very easygoing and helpful. He made breakfast one morning which was excellent and very nice of him. He was outgoing and personable. We had a couple of interesting  discussions about music, food, and other topics. Checking in was simple. Greg met me when I arrived, left me a key, showed me the place, and introduced me to his two little dogs. The dogs were friendly and very well behaved. The place was exactly as described. Athough older, the two rooms and bathroom were clean and the basement setting was private.  The apartment location was excellent, on a great street in a very cool neighborhood. There is a Starbucks across the street and numerous restaurants and bars within walking distance. I enjoyed my stay and would stay here again. 
1398616	5934114	41477	6672962	Oli	It was my girlfriend's and I first time visiting Chicago, our flight was delayed, we ended up arriving at 2am.. and Michael & Jackie were awesome throughout it all! The place was really nice and clean.. the room was comfy and private. They even put out donuts for us in the morning ! They really made the trip a pleasant one. We hope to see Michael & Jackie again soon! 
1398616	6098101	41484	7607371	Anne	First of all, I was impressed by the response time to my request, within not even 5min I received feedback that the room was available for my requested dates. The key handover and the whole stay in general were really uncomplicated. The area where the apartment is located was convenient in terms of parking and accessibility to the city. I really enjoyed staying there and felt comfortable in my room. Jackie and Michael are really nice people who even took care of breakfast for me and showed me a street festival in Chicago. Thanks for everything that made my stay in Chicago unforgettable!
1398616	6208596	41489	7816925	Oscar	Michael and Jackie were great!  They was extremely fast in responding to my questions prior to booking.  The place was very nice and very clean, I would have never guessed they had pets.  The animals were very nice and never bothered.  Michael and Jackie were great hosts and very helpful.  I would definitely recommend Michael and Jackie and can't thank them enough for everything.
1398616	6231478	41490	7749063	Mirjam	I was only in town for two days and Jackie and Michael did everything to make it a wonderful experience and memory. Their apartment is not only 'cute', but shows their great taste in interior decoration, coffee, and literature. With an injury from the previous day I didn't know if you could actually go to Chicago and they immediately offered their help. I really liked their snoopy cats and sweet-tempered dog. The separate room gave me all the privacy I needed.
1398616	6287889	41492	7499293	Miranda	We absolutely loved staying with Michael and Jackie! The room was very private, clean, and comfortable. They have a tastefully decorated home with sweet animals as well as a lovely collection of books. Michael was laid back but more quiet while Jackie was eager to have a conversation with you (in a non invasive yet friendly way.) They are relatively new airbnb hosts but do a wonderful job at giving you space and making your stay as welcoming as possible. They even invited us to share a meal with them and we ended up missing our Saturday night plans because we were enjoying our time so much. LOCATION : Very convenient access to the train which takes you downtown as well as to the midway airport in no time! There are cute little places to eat around the apartment and its a very architecturally rich neighborhood as far as the unique style of buildings and homes go. The only mildly negative thing is the lack of mirrors. There was no mirror in our room and as two girls we didn't want to feel like we were taking over their bathroom. Other than that, everything was great. We would definitely come back. 
1398616	6335843	41494	6451855	Daniel	Michael and Jackie are great hosts !! They were very hospitable and kind.The room was very nice, comfy and clean. It was exactly what we needed for a night in Chicago. 
1398616	6573106	41503	413273	Jillian	My sister and I had a brief but fantastic stay at Michael and Jackie's. We found the apartment clean and comfortable as well as ideally located. Our hosts were friendly, welcoming, flexible, and accommodating. The neighborhood was really great, close to downtown but still super-easy to find parking, with a cute coffee shop on the corner. We saw lots of kids and dogs and vegetable gardens while we were wandering around. The guest bedroom was supremely comfortable, from bed to temperature to noise level. I would highly recommend this place to anyone!
1398616	6863022	41513	6909921	Julius	I only had a short stay at Michael and Jackie's place, but it was great. A good neighborhood, a very cool designed house. The room was clean and comfortably. Michael and Jackie are two very cool people. Very helpful. It is a little bit sad that I missed a sox game. It is recommended. 
1398616	7018668	41520	7915450	William	Michael and Jackie greeted me when I arrived at their place and promptly left for the weekend, so I had a very private three nights at their large, comfortable, home in a lovely Chicago neighborhood. It was a perfect place for me as I was in town for a wedding at the Bridgeport Arts Center, a short walk away from their digs. There was also an easy trip into center city.Michael responded to all messages, almost immediately. Both welcomed me warmly and offered helpful advice about the Metro.My bedroom was cozy, clean, comfortable, and very private (even had my hosts been at home.)
1398616	7081731	41522	5821774	Perry-N-Janice	I had a pleasant stay with Michael and Jacklyn,The room was very tidy and the neighborhood was quiet. The best part of my stay is that there was a great beer pub just a stones throw away from their front door.
1398616	7185571	41526	8628772	Ha	I had a stay at Michael and Jackie's place this September and it felt absolutely homy and cozy! That's just what you need if you're a budget traveller. Adorable room, nice flat, great cats, quite safe area (seems to be), really close to Loop and VERY hospitable hosts, thank you guys!) 
1398616	7284980	41531	4585218	Lara	I had a great time with Michael and Jackie! It was my first experience with airbnb and a very positive one. Michael and Jackie gave me tips what I could do and where I could go. I really enjoyed the time at their place. It's close to a subway station(15min walk or with the bus) and your within a couple of minutes downtown. The way to the midway airport is also very easy.I don't know what else to say. It was just a great time and I would definitely stay there again.
1398616	7309330	41532	6581391	Liam	Really nice couple and really nice room - fully recommended!
1398616	7356316	41533	1792835	Arrika	This was our first Air BnB experience and it was great! Michael and Jacquelyn were very hospitable and relaxed. My husband and I felt complete freedom to come and go as we pleased (which was good because we had a lot planned!) and they even gave us some good tips on where to go in the city and how to get there. The room was comfortable and clean and very affordable. The location was perfect because we parked for free on the street. It was about a 10-15 minute walk to the El station with a straight shot into downtown. Thanks for a great place to stay!
1398616	7610204	41543	8796406	Tim	Stayed to access McCormick Place & it worked out great! Classic Chicago neighborhood enclave. Michael & Jackie were pleasant and accommodating. I would stay again & recommend to friends.
1398616	7646346	41545	6630530	Michael	Cozy and comfy!! Very nice to deal with and make you feel at home. If I'm back in the area I wil check with them first!
1398616	7719970	41547	2442863	Surya & Angelo	Clean, cost and nice room! The whole apartment is very spacious and nice! Michael and Jackie are very welcoming and helpful for all questions you have! The neighborhood is very cool and laid back, upcoming but not too trendy! The apt is pretty central, you need around 15min walking to the subway station. Thank you for the great stay!
1398616	7802469	41550	7685391	Aleksejs	Michael and Jackie are great people. They are laidback, hospitable and very easy to talk. They helped me with some advices regarding commuting and sightseeing. Strongly recommend his place for everyone!!!
1398616	7890841	41554	8918352	Simon	Michael was unbelievably quick with answering questions in advance.  As this was my first AirBNB experience I was very grateful. Jackie was dead helpful in giving me guidance on where to visit so that on my spare day and a half, I really had an excellent time visiting sites that were perfect for me.There is a great coffee-shop and bakery 50 yards away on the corner of South Morgan and West 31st Street. I had little time to explore the whole neighbourhood, but it was very safe walking from the Orange Line station at Ashland. For me it was great to stay in a real neighbourhood, rather than some artificial downtown area.
1398616	8088544	41562	8757913	JÃ©rÃ´me	We really enjoyed our stay at Michael & Jackie's home: we enjoyed chatting with them; they have a very pleasant apartment and convenient location to visit Chicago, ca. 10min walk from metro.JÃ©rÃ´me & Elodie
1398616	8299997	41571	9289788	Ashar	No frills tiny room, microscopic shared bathroom with no exhaust fan, hard to find parking spot on the street. Got a parking ticket for not moving the car at 7am (street cleaning rules). 
1398616	8319765	41572	9469133	Shannon	I was only there one brief evening, but Michael and Jackie were very accommodating to my late arrival. Comfy bed, nice shower and friendly pussy cats (only if you want to meet them, hardly knew they were there). Thanks for accepting me as a guest, I would like to experience Bridgeport under less hectic circumstances.
1398616	8353592	41574	2106917	Emily	Great room--small, but very well-appointed and cozy, with a lot of helpful little things (a travel hair dryer, shampoo packets, Kleenex) in the bedside table. Super sweet cats, and Michael and Jackie were pretty quiet and low-key. 
1398616	8393977	41575	9551940	Stacy	This was my first Airbnb experience and it was a great one. Communicating with Michael was a breeze and always timely. It was a cozy place to stay with wonderful food and coffee right across the street. I will definitely look into staying here again next time I plan a trip to Chicago!Thanks for everything, Michael and Jackie!
1398616	8614702	41586	5704209	Christopher	Michael and Jackie were excellent hosts!  They were very accommodating - Michael happened to be driving in the area of the Orange Line when I was rolling into town from Midway and he picked me up at the station and brought me to the apartment.  Michael and Jackie are also to be commended for a great attention to detail.  There was a Keurig single-cup coffee machine in the room, as well as spare toiletries.  The room has an adjustable vent and its own window, so if you have a preference for sleeping in a cool environment (as I do) you can adjust it to your liking.  The hosts were nice enough to allow me to store a few food items in the fridge and shared some of the cookies they made one night.  All in all, a great experience!PS:  If you're a cyclist, you'd be thrilled to know that Michael and Jackie's place is a one-to-two-minute walk from one of Chicago's new Divvy bike-share stations.
1398616	8772799	41595	4074932	Jay	This was a very cool space, and I could tell from my messages/phone conversation that I'd like Michael and Jackie. Unfortunately, my schedule didn't allow our paths to cross in person. The room was great and I had no trouble letting myself in or out. I'd definitely return.
1398616	8822952	41597	6082704	Kevin	Really comfortable bed, 2 lovely cats, nice host!! Highly recommend!!
1398616	8907072	41603	9737250	Yushan	Micheal and Jackie are very nice. The room is clean and very comfortable. Highly recommended. 
1398616	8956597	41606	2523948	Grace	Michael and Jackie are awesome! I visited Chicago alone and they were so welcoming and helpful! Their apartment is exactly as described, and it is nice to have your own personal space.  I am hoping to return to Chicago in the summer one day and I will definitely be staying with them :) 
1398616	9089297	41614	9158681	Karla	I had a great stay with Michael & Jackie in Chicago! They were super easy to communicate with, helpful and just generally lovely and welcoming. The room was perfect and location was easy to get to, with my commutes between the airport, Downtown and McCormick convention centre. Definitely recommend staying here.
1398616	9343057	41631	8309393	Malin	Michael and Jackie were very wellcoming! Even though my boyfriend and I arrived much later than we had planned (customs and border protection at the ariport!), they waited up for us and showed us around their flat. We didn't spend much time in the flat (so much to see and do and so little time..) but felt at home at once. Michael and Jackie also gave us a lot of tips on what to see, do and eat in Chicago. Thank you for having us!PS:  Their cats are adorable!
1398616	9932599	41659	3654712	Chris	We have now stayed with several AirBnB hosts, and Jackie and Mike have an ideal apartment.  The place was clean, easy to find, and very comfortable.  Their cats are also friendly, and street parking wasn't a problem.  We would recommend staying here.
1398616	10357155	41685	11820145	Liliana	Michael and Jackie are super personable and friendly, they made my first experience of staying at someone elseâ€™s place very pleasant, they were both very friendly and welcoming. The apartment was very close to downtown, and super cute.  I would definitely recommend their place! Thank you so much for everything :)
1398616	10986947	41714	9952221	Izamara	The apartment is very good. It was clean, comfortable and has a good location, it was easy go to downtown, about 30 minutes from downtown. Michael and Jackie are very friendly. 
1398616	11063892	41716	12007686	Jun Xiu	Having great time in chicago! michael and jackie are awesome! they are friendly and welcoming. we arrived chicago at very late. Mike picked us up at the station once i gave him a call (taxi only available one hour after). the apartment was clean and comfortable. it's a great place to stay. highly recommmend!
1398616	12101376	41751	6702022	Jean Patrice	Good place. Good city. Great host. This is the kind of place / host the creators of airbnb had in mind when they created this website. 
1398616	12187765	41754	11924126	Tyson	My first time with Airbnb and it was great! Michael & Jackie are very quick with response. The two cats are really friendly and it was nice they were there. The place is relatively close to the metro(orange line) and there is a bikes you can close by which was convenient. The place was peaceful, clean and felt like home. Thanks for everything.
1398616	13240060	41782	12875415	Mariana	The expectations on the hosts were exceeded. Mike & Jackie are great guys, we even got their friendship after our visit, always attentive and trying to make our stay more confortable. Shared some tips and even coupons for touristic atractions. They even picked us up from the train station upon our arrival. The neigborhood has a great coffee place, and a bar just half a block away, bicycle rentals, convenience stores and more everything walking distance. 
1398616	13365786	41785	4379842	Jai	I had a fantastic stay with Michael and Jackie in Chicago! Awesome folks, great place, cool neighborhood (some really cool restaurants/bars within walking distance) and very close to downtown/public transport. Overall a great first experience with AirBnb, would definitely recommend staying here!
1398616	13691046	41792	15214003	Eusebia	The days in Chicago really were incredible. I had a fantastic stay with Michael and Jackie! They are very friendly and nice people. They were very attentive with me and they helped me to find places in order to visit. Great place, the neigborhood has a great coffee just half a block away and very close to downtown. First time with Airbnb and it was great experience! 
1398616	14270332	41806	436553	Rosalyn	Michael and Jackie are kind and generous Air BnB hosts. I was treated to a Mediterranean dinner and a walking art tour of the neighborhood because  I am an artist.  We got along very well and I felt extremely at ease with them.  They went out of their way to make sure that I was able to get to where I needed to go during my stay in Chicago, dropping me off in their car to the train station .  The room was as promised , it was clean and comfortable and I liked having the coffee pot in the room.  No problems getting around from where they live, and felt safe in the neighborhood at night.
1398616	14443864	41809	4440160	Qisha	Our stay with Michael and Jackie was great. Their place is close to Chinatown so that was a huge plus for us. The room is a little cramped for two people (plus our bags) but it didn't bother us much. Check-in was very quick and easy. There is street parking but sometimes if you come back late at night it's a little difficult to find a space on the street right in front. If you're not really a cat person keep in mind that they will come into the room if you leave it open. Overall, it was a good experience.
1398616	14650480	41813	15691771	Leif & Nat	We can't say enough about these two!! Fantastic people. They made our first airbnb a memorable one. The hung out with us, showed us the city and actually became people we would call friends. I guess you always remember your first. :) we look forward to hanging out with them again, whether it be in Canada or back in Chicago. Great clean home with lots of charm. 
1398616	15063562	41821	438558	Iain	Helpful hosts, fantastic apartment, cute pets. Close enough to public transport (#8 bus, Orange Line), quiet street, felt safe. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
1398616	15278786	41826	12859662	Mattie	We had a short but pleasant stay at Michael and Jackie's place! They were super flexible with our arrival time and even let us borrow a museum pass! The room was clean and comfortable. LOVED the keurig coffee maker in the room.
1398616	15514685	41830	1591821	Michael	Michael and Jackie were incredibly welcoming, accommodating, and trusting during my stay.  I would not hesitate to contact them again if I am in the area.  They recommended great restaurants and I had a great time talking with Michael about Chicago, design, and travels.  The neighborhood is nice and seems plenty safe.  Parking was not generally problematic.  It took at most a couple minutes to find a nearby spot and that was when I returned one morning at 1:00.
1398616	15658892	41833	17647256	Dan	We loved our stay in Michael and Jackie's apartment. It was clean, neat, and really a beautiful space. We felt welcome and relaxed from the moment we walked in the door. Check out the cafe across the street.

1398616	16792491	41853	403585	Cat	Fantastic apartment, nice & clean, lots of space. Public transport to the city and other areas of Chicago were handy and easy to use - even for someone as useless as me! Great little cafe just across the road. Michael & Jackie were lovely and really helpful with any questions I had, though I didn't spend much time with them. ABSOLUTELY LOVED THEIR DOG. 
1398616	17211870	41860	10680873	Maria	Our stay with Michael and Jackie was great. The room was comfortable and clean. We didn't spend much time in the flat, but they were very hospitable and relaxed. We felt complete freedom to come and go as we pleased. Sweet cats and dog. Would recommend to anyone! 
1398616	17383039	41862	18294654	Evelyn	The hosts where wonderful really made us feel at home and comfortable.We loved the puppy. The apartment was very cute and loved the artistic details it had. The neighborhood was a little sketchy at some points but nothing dangerous. We loved the coffe shop righ across. Awesome coffee & baked goods.Thank you for making our stay in Chicago great! 
1398616	17959885	41870	15255044	Ksenia	I had a wonderful time at Michael and Jackie's place. The room was nice and clean. The neighbourhood is great and very convenient, close to bus station and subway. The hosts are very friendly and willing to help. There is also a very nice coffee shop just about the corner, which I really liked.I would definitely recommend this place to anyone :)
1398616	18046555	41871	19645366	Ryan	Great apartment, convenient location, and Michael was very friendly. I would stay here again. 
1398616	18116201	41873	17161697	Beni	We really enjoyed our stay at Michael and Jackie's place. The apartment is near downtown. You could walk a few minutes to the Orange Line Station or the Bus station. In addition, there is a Divvy Station on the street where the apartment is located. By the way, this place is close to the Chinatown.Michael and Jackie are very friendly, and their puppy and kitties are very cute. The interior design of their apartment is delicate and the room is comfortable and clean. Highly recommend!
1398616	18557702	41879	18987396	Federico E Laura	Appartamento molto particolare e carino! La stanza Ã¨ accogliente e Micheal, Jackie e i loro animali sono stati di compagnia. Siamo stati molto bene! Assolutamente consigliato!!
1398616	18782094	41883	11967424	Brandi	Michael and Jackie have a very nice home and are extremely accommodating. Michael met with us and informed us that they would be gone for the weekend, but he talked with us about our stay and made us feel welcome. The bed was very comfortable and we greatly appreciated the Keurig in the room! The cats were friendly and sweet. We had no problem finding street parking and there were lots of places within walking distance to shop and eat. We absolutely loved our stay and would definitely book again when visiting Chicago if they'd have us!
1398616	19145098	41889	19791442	David	We stayed for three nights in Michael and Jackie's apartment. The room and the apt. were clean, we got fresh sheets and towels upon arrival. The place is also conveniently located as its close to the orange line which takes you to the loop in 10 minutes. Stores are nearby and the neighborhood is quiet during the evening hours.Michael and Jackie were really friendly and easygoing. This was our first experience with Airbnb and we couldn't have asked for better hosts. I'd definitely recommend them if you're looking for a nice place in Chicago.
1398616	19425679	41894	16439322	Jason	This was a great neighborhood, felt very safe.  Michael and Jackie were great hosts.  I did not get to interact with them very much since this was a business trip and I was on the go.  We had a little miscommunication one night, but they graciously resolved the matter and there was no love lost.  There were great places in the neighborhood to eat and a nice coffee shop across the street.  I would stay again on another visit to Chicago.
1398616	19611626	41897	5602870	Holly	Michael and Jackie were great hosts - very friendly and helpful.  The apartment was just as they described and in a nice residential neighborhood.  My boyfriend and I walked from the train (we took the Orange Line in from Midway) and it was about a 20 minute walk to the apartment from the stop.  Very convenient.  Check-in was super smooth and we enjoyed our stay with them!
1398616	19724301	41899	9241762	Brendan	"The accommodation offered by Michael and Jackie was as  described in their listing. Michael  welcomed   us on our arrival and showed us all necessary facilities. Our location was ideal for our visit with our son , a UoC grad student. Note that there is Chicago City bicycle rental stand at junction of Morgan and 31st - it was useful diversion to use during the excellent weather"" laid on"" for our visit. Will keep this address for future visits."
1398616	19953882	41903	8574105	Razvan	The place is really nice and very close to downtown,the host is very  kind and welcoming. 
1398616	20044608	41904	20488080	Diedre	Jackie and Michael were extremely nice and very accommodating. Their pets are very sweet. Everything went well and as expected. Bedroom and bathroom were clean. Thank you!
1398616	20430322	41911	20292336	Marina	Michael was really friendly and showed us everything. During our stay we haven't met often.The bed is comftable and the room nice. With a big luggage the room becomes small. The area was quiet nice with small coffee stores.Unfortunately the bath was a little vit dirty and smelt strange.Everything else was fine
1398616	20886231	41918	4519310	Yixiang	Michael and Jackie are perfect hosts. We had no problem communicating with them. And they were very friendly and ready for any questions at any time. The cats and dog were awesome too. Great location, quiet neighborhood, we had a great stay for 2 nights. Would recommend this place to anyone. 
1398616	21480643	41930	15975473	Helen	Great apartment, about 10mins train ride downtown, clean with friendly pets. Michael and Jackie were both great hosts will definitely stay there again.
1398616	21859668	41937	9879177	Zachary	Thank you Michael and Jackie, your rental was the perfect space for my needs of a low cost room for a visitor spending most of my time away exploring Chicago. The layout gave host and visitor privacy, there was no noise or awkward 'am I intruding?' feeling.Location is very accessible from Midway airport, the downtown Loop and CTA Orange line. A nice block with a local coffee spot, a few dining choices (try Bridgeport Pasty!) and lots of character.  A 'Divvy' (think CitiBike) rental station is located 50' away making the transport to train station an easy ride.The room is small. but well appointed, with a very comfortable double bed, ceiling fan, plenty of power outlets, closet and great morning sunshine!Look forward to staying again on future trips to Chicago.
1398616	21942176	41939	15499023	Lisa	Great price.  Excellent location to Orange line and bus.  Easy to get to and from Midway airport.
1398616	22322953	41946	22549537	Patrick	A great location! Transit's close and downtown isn't far at all. The room is cozy and quiet; just what we were looking for. Michael and Jackie were super helpful in getting us oriented to Chicago.
1398616	22480991	41950	511299	Andrew	Michael and Jackie were consummate hosts, with great communication from the second we made our instant booking. The room, like their entire flat, is beautifully designed with a boisterous and adorable puppy to boot. The apartment has easy on-street parking and is conveniently located for the Halsted 'L' station on the Orange Line which is only a couple of stops from the downtown Loop. We had a great breakfast at farm-to-table local spot Nana which is only a couple of blocks away and the explored Chicago's Riverwalk and the incredible art in Millennium Park. Thoroughly recommend staying with Jackie and Michael and having a lovely trip to Chicago! 
1398616	22868985	41959	18926499	William	wonderful
1398616	23124746	41966	23651775	Prateek	This was my first airbnb experience and I must say that it was a good one.The place was exactly as described. I liked the room and the location was perfect for me as I had to travel to downtown a lot.Mike was there to answer my queries and though I didn't get to interact with Jackie much, they both made me feel welcome.Thanks you for the warm reception and I hope to come back again soon.
1398616	23283457	41970	713107	Elizabeth	Michael and Jackie and were great hosts- we stayed for two nights and loved the apartment. The layout makes you feel very independent, but we also felt very comfortable using the kitchen, et cetera. Everything was very clean and comfortable, and I definitely recommend staying here!
1398616	23440173	41974	14611810	Fanping	Michael and Jackie's place is superb in Bridgeport, and I would say it is outstanding even in the entire Chicago metro area.  The chic feeling of an artist/designer home is waiting for you to experience.  We loved their cats and petted the fatter one of them.  We also appreciated the big and cozy bed.  It is safe and clean, and I would definitely recommend it to my friends.  Most likely, I will choose to stay here again on my next visit to Chicago.
1398616	23747610	41982	17200653	Zoe	I needed a place to stay close to the Bridgeport Art Center for a weekend event.  The place was neat and clean and close to just the right amount of amenities for a weekend trip.  There was a cute bakery/restaurant, lovely little craft brew bar, and a coffee shop all on the corner right by the apartment.  There was also a 'mainstream' kind of hilariously random grocery store and CVS down the street about 3 blocks for random stuff you might need, or have forgotten to bring with.  The neighborhood definitely has that artsy, transitional, up-and-coming sort of vibe, very ethnically mixed, so if a little walking and such isn't your sort of thing, then keep that in mind.  As a woman, I felt safe walking around during the day and early in the evening.  Michael and Jackie were very sweet and accomodating, so were the canine and feline residents. 
1398616	28239509	42083	27182221	Victoria	Jackie and Michael were very nice and answered all our questions, even if we didn't get to see them much. The neigborhood was quiet, and the room was cosy. The metro is a 15/20 minutes walk, and there is a bike station right next to the house.The photos are not up to date, as there are more furnitures added to the house. Unfortunately, there was a lot of pet's hair, and the house was not very clean in general.
1398616	29049778	42097	5152553	SÃ©bastien	Michael and Jackie were good hosts that made our stay very pleasant. Their appartment is well located, easy to access from Midway Airport and close to downtown. The neighborhood is calm, with an appreciated cafe at the corner of the street (nice latte !). The appartment was clean and they were very welcoming. Although we didn't see much because of our busy schedule, they were always easy to communicate and give us nice recommendations when we met. Also, their dog and two cats are very friendly too :P ! We recommend them ! 
1398616	29874959	42107	13493929	Elizabeth	Michael and Jackie were awesome with my unusual request. They were welcoming and clear with directions/where to find things. Cats were very warm and inviting as well! Overall,  they are a cute couple with a  very cool,well kept, clean place. Would definitely recommend ! 
1398616	30091502	42111	30094256	Andrew	Great Experience! Both Michael and Jackie were very kind and welcoming.  Definitely recommend staying with them! Had a very nice stay and the room was clean and comfortable.  
1398616	30353711	42114	31111048	Cameron	Michael and Jackie offer a great place to stay the weekend. I came here with my girlfriend for a business/pleasure combo getaway--came for an academic conference, stayed to enjoy cool stuff in Chicago. The hosts maintain a great place to crash at the end of the day--they have clearly dedicated a lot of effort and ingenuity in decorating their apartment. We loved their pets, who are not only adorable but--even better--also extremely affectionate.The location in Bridgeport is a bit away from the downtown area, but I had no trouble using public transport to get to the Loop area quickly and cheaply.
1398616	30637279	42119	2591303	Matt	Michael and Jackie were great hosts. I enjoyed getting to speak with them and we watched some Bulls and Blackhawks playoff games together. It was easy to come and go as I needed. The room was well stocked with an iron and ironing board, small toiletry items, and a space heater (although I didn't need it).The neighborhood seemed nice and quiet. There's a really neat park nearby with lots of walking trails. I like walking, so being about a mile from the orange line train worked well for me. Also, I recommend  Bridgeport Coffee shop, which is really close to the apartment. 
1398616	31255284	42127	31890593	Toby	It' s cool place and clean, though the bedroom we lived is a little bit small (full size bed). Both Michael and Jackie are nice and considerate. All the shampoo, body wash, and other utilities are prepared. They also recommended us the restaurant when we were arrival at 9:00pm. 
1398616	31385820	42128	31793797	Ning	Michael and Jackie always responded right away when I contacted them and made sure everything is okay. Everything is as described and photographed. The guidebook is also very helpful! Unfortunately we didn't get to meet in person because they were busy out. Would recommend this place!
1398616	31527612	42130	25353244	Violet	Michael and Jackie are very kind and hospitable hosts. They were very helpful when it came to things like directions, things to do, and providing luxuries like wifi. I was very happy with the room I stayed in and enjoyed the company of the cats and dog. I would recommend this airbnb listing to anyone visiting Chicago.  Oh and I am very glad there was a hair dryer in the drawers in the bedroom! Thanks for a great stay, guys!
1398616	31618512	42131	17285054	Brad	Great location, nice people. Last minute booking and it was smooth as silk. Very friendly dog, if you're not a dog lover you might find him in your face a bit, all good for me though. Great craft beer, coffee, middle easter food all within 100 metres. 
1398616	31673758	42132	32272769	Neil	Our host greeted us at the door and was friendly and helpful. The room was nice with a comfortable bed and clean bathroom. The pets were friendly and a welcome addition to our experience. The neighborhood location was very convenient - we were in downtown within 20 minutes of driving in the morning rush. We found parking easily around the corner and only wish we had more time to stay.
1398616	31984071	42136	2435261	Julie	Michael and Jackie were great hosts, making us feel so welcome and at home! We loved the local feel of the neighbourhood, it made our first stay in Chicago even more memorable! We used the city cards Michael and Jackie left in our room a lot, and they proved to be amazing, we covered so much ground in a very little time! I would recommend staying at Michael and Jackie to anyone (except if you are allergic to pets!).
1398616	32684840	42144	29596136	Kyle	Michael and Jackie were both very friendly and accommodating, and even offered us a ride to and from the train with our luggage. We also enjoyed the company of their pets, who were very friendly and fun to be around. The room was simple but very comfortable and suited our needs perfectly. The walk to and from the train got a bit lengthy day after day, but it simply forced us to plan our trips into the city better. Great value!
1398616	32867867	42146	33657322	Ismet	It was my first time on Airbnb. I was kinda nervous at the beginning, but Michael and his lovely dog were a pretty nice host. I would say listing description was accurate enough. Room was clean and small,but enough for 2 people. There is a nice coffee shop so close to apt. Free parking was the best part about the neighborhood.
1398616	33234546	42150	28514513	Meg	We had a great time at Michael and Jackie's. Their apartment is just as pictured, the bed as super comfortable and their pets were very sweet. We walked to the sox game and several other shops, bars and restaurants in Bridgeport. We also really enjoyed the divy bike rentals. The apartment was convenient to downtown and transportation and we didn't have a problem finding parking right outside the apartment.  
1398616	33775208	42156	15863399	Linda	We had a comfortable and enjoyable stay at Michael and Jackie's apartment. Michael is a sweet and welcoming guy who's a self-described hands-off host. The apartment is clean, spacious, and homey. During our three night stay, I always found a parking spot right outside the apartment, as the listing describes. Almost every restaurant, bar, or cafe within a few blocks has 4 or 5 stars, so it was nice to have a lot of walkable options. I'd like to stay here again next time I'm in Bridgeport!
1398616	34022382	42158	33843493	Manuel D.	Jackie and Michael were very nice! They have a lovely place. I will visit them again. Love their pets.
1398616	34227974	42161	33467849	Mark	I did enjoy staying with Michael and Jackie! Connecting with them to first drop off my luggage was very simple, and the place itself had everything one would need for their stay. I spent nearly all of my time that night in the city, so I didn't get to talk with the hosts very much, but they seem like very amiable and pleasant people.
1398616	34677198	42165	19532416	Judy	I had a delightful evening at Michael and Jackie's.  Jackie is very friendly and welcoming.  I hope to meet Michael on my next stay.  My room was comfortable and met my needs quite well.  Very early the next morning I spent 30 minutes at the very nice coffee house across the street.  It has a beautiful original tin ceiling.  There are restaurants a couple doors away (as well as a package store) and their bookshelf is full of great lit.  What else could one ask for?
1398616	34807006	42167	29244223	Mk	Michael and Jackie have a very sweet and artistic home! Everything's just as the pictures show. Lovely animals, especially the super hospitable dog :). Michael is very responsive and helpful before and during the check in, and offered me quite some useful suggestions about my trip.  I enjoyed a lot of privacy as the guest room is kinda apart from the other part of the apartment. A bit walk from the nearest subway station but generally good access to traffic. 
1398616	34979722	42169	33236392	Lori	Michael and Jackie were great! Good communication, very welcoming and fun to visit with. The apartment was clean & well-kept, bed was comfortable and cozy.  Bathroom was in the midst of some maintenance, but these things happen and issues were promptly amended.  Pets are all friendly and pleasant to be around.  Appreciated the opportunity to see a new part of Chicago. Delicious Mediterranean food just a walk across the street.  Super 2-night stay!
1398616	35304907	42172	31669496	Emilio	Michael and Jackie were great hosts! Very accommodating and laid back. They were super helpful with tips on getting around the city and great places to check out. Their home is awesome. It's really cozy and they also have really friendly pets that make you feel welcome. The neighborhood also has some great little gems.. the corner coffee shop is great, as well as the pizza place down the street. This was our first air bnb experience, and I really think we lucked out with Michael and Jackie as our first hosts. Thanks!
1398616	35492100	42174	30605540	Sara	Michael was very helpful upon arrival and made us feel comfortable, then left us alone for the most part, which is great for us because we like to do our own thing. He made sure we knew we could contact him if we need anything. The apartment is convenient to the orange line, about a 20 min walk, but there was parking at the stop, and also a Bike share near the apartment and the station. Overall, a great deal for Chicago. 
1398616	36185373	42181	32523612	Wade	Michael and Jackie were great about making us feel comfortable when we got there and made sure we had everything we needed. They were excellent about not making us feel intrusive and for the most part left us alone. The apartment was clean (basically exactly like the photos) and the pets were awesome!
1398616	36897908	42187	35419969	Raji	Both hosts were wonderful and made us feel very welcome. The apartment was beautiful, and the room was very private. Parking was free and very close. Michael and Jackie gave us a few tips on places to eat and how to get around that were much appreciated. Staying here really made our trip great!
1398616	37287654	42191	28512742	Marni	Jackie and Michael were the perfect hosts. We knew exactly where to go and what to do upon our arrival due to their excellent communication. We were lucky to connect with them to get insider tips on how to explore the city more as a local than a tourist. We took their bar, restaurant, and boat tour advice and were extremely pleased. I also enjoyed the blog which was very helpful. The room was comfortable with air-conditioning and a fan. We loved the location and the walk to the train line. There is even a near by park with views of downtown that we almost would have missed if it was not for their advice. We felt safe in the neighborhood and the locals were nice and helpful. 
1398616	37554192	42193	30082395	James Chung Yen	Michael was an accomodating and friendly host.  He provided me with some suggestions about how to get around in Chicago and where to do grocery shopping.  The room was clean as advertised.  I saw a dog and a cat.  His big nice dog slept beside my room door at night.  It surprised me in the beginning, but later I felt a sense of security because it was just like a bodyguard taking care of me at night.  Quite a nice experience for a traveler who came to the US for the first time.  Thanks, Michael.
1398616	37858781	42196	32662956	Sara	Siamo stati da Michael e Jackie per 3 notti, tutto perfetto, la casa Ã¨ grande, la camera riservata, loro sono molto carini e disponibili e il loro animali anche! :-)La fermata della metro si trova ad una ventina di minuti a piedi (ed Ã¨ a due fermate dal loop) e il quartiere sembra molto tranquillo. Abbiamo apprezzato il bar all'angolo per le nostre colazioni e la possibilitÃ  di parcheggiare l'auto gratuitamente non lontano. In definitiva consigliamo la loro casa per chi vuole visitare Chicago, noi siamo stati molto bene ed abbiamo avuto una totale indipendenza.
1398616	38282518	42199	34109335	Brittany	Michael and Jackie were great from the beginning! They were accommodating to the fact that we didn't get in until pretty late, which was very nice. Our room was clean and comfortable and their animals are extremely well behaved and so loving! I couldn't get enough of them. My boyfriend however is allergic to cats, but the room was kept cat free so he had absolutely no problem being there. Michael and Jackie are great hosts. They're knowledgable to their city and very welcoming. Michael even gave us a lift to the train station to save us the cab fair when we were leaving! We enjoyed our stay in Chicago and would stay with them again! 
1398616	38566012	42201	2128652	Emil	We had a great stay at Michael and Jackie's place. Unfortunately we didn't get to meet Jackie as we were out exploring the city most of the time. Michael was a great host and very accommodating. They had great recommendations for the city and neighborhood (see blog and guidebook) Nice coffee spot on the corner. The room is clean and cozy with air conditioning and a fan. We loved their pets!
1398616	39275249	42207	32298495	Chiaki	Michael and Jackie made us feel very welcomed upon our arrival and throughout our stay. They were there when needed but also did a great job making visitors feel like their space was our own. They were very easy to talk to as far as recommending nooks and crannies of Chicago that we might like. We loved the location of their house, which was in an up and coming neighborhood with a coffee shop, bar, and many eateries that were very close in walking distance.The location allowed us to easily get around on foot and by train. The room is very cozy and fits two people just right. It felt great going back to it for a nap after a long jam packed day exploring the different neighborhoods of Chicago. Overall our stay at their apt and first time visiting Chicago was a great trip that we will remember for a very long time.
1398616	39497662	42209	33895768	Matthew	Such a lovely welcoming couple! They helped me to arrange my partners birthday with their local knowledge and provided me with the opportunity to enjoy our trip. Would highly recommended this place to anyone. It's local to the metro and quirky local venues. 
1398616	39650407	42210	36484768	Gina	Enjoyed the information left in the room regarding the neighbourhood.
1398616	39819259	42211	32094104	Brieana	A lot of fun and extremely welcoming! My husband even accidentally left his ring in the bathroom when we left. Michael and Jackie mailed the ring to us right away! Such great people!
1398616	41180083	42220	30185	Aviv	Michael and Jackie accomodated my very late booking request, were very welcoming and made an effort to make me feel at home. The room is cozy and comfortable and the location is convenient.
1398616	42412660	42229	7605849	Jennifer	To keep it simple, comfy private room with laid back, friendly hosts with super sweet cats and a pup. Very accessible by train and bus. Enjoyed my stay and would book again!
1398616	42894050	42232	25527978	Tram	Michael and Jackie were wonderful hosts- they were friendly, helpful ,hospitable and absolutely respected our privacy during our stay. Greatly recommended!
1398616	43516456	42236	37621080	MarÃ­a Jimena	Muy bien todo, un apartamento lindo y acogedor.
1398616	43962748	42239	38449319	Olena	Very friendly and accommodating. Nice, quiet neighborhood. Easy to travel to the loop or anywhere your heart desires. Cats ready to be pet - always a plus.
1398616	44435413	42242	33918291	HuiGuo	Michael and Jackie are very friendly. The neighborhood feels safe to me. The whole place is spacious, huge living room. You don't run into Michael and Jackie a lot 'cause their room is on the other end of the whole space. The bedroom is a little smaller than I expected, but is still adequate. They have two cats and one large dog, all of which are very friendly, too. I very much enjoyed my stay!
1398616	44655527	42244	37761799	Lisa	We were only in Chicago for two nights. However it is an amazing city that needs more time to explore! We discovered a local bar just down the road from Michael and Jackies that had craft beers, cocktails and a very cool vibe. A short drive into the city the next day meant we had a whole day to explore as much as we could! 
1398616	45264015	42248	25209164	Manfred	Michael and Jackie are a lovely couple, always endeavored to ensure your sphere of privacy nonetheless up for a talk if you want to.There are also a lovely dog as well as two cats in the aparment. They are obviously used to people and well-bred but I would not recommend this place if you are afraid / not in favor of animals. The apartment is also pretty close to the city center, though keep in mind that Chicago is a big city. Usually it takes you 40-60 minutes to get downtown using public transportation.
1398616	46584175	42259	8077958	Liesbeth & Jimmy	Michael and Jackie are great hosts. They are friendly, they got great tips on places to visit and spot to get good food. The room is nice, a bit small, but clean and with air-condition. That's a big plus since it was rly hot ( +- 85F / 29C), the days that we where staying there in mid September. They have a really sweet dog and 2 fantastic cats :)Chicago is a big city, so you need some time to get around. There are lots of busses and metro's around, to get you from a to b. Great place to stay if you don't mind traveling a bit (20 min) to get to downtown :)
1398616	47160172	42263	35275728	James	Fantastic apartment right on the doorstep of Chinatown, just a mile from the home of the White Sox and half s mile from the amazing Bridgeport Diner.Halstead on the Orange line CTA network is 5 mins away and at the top of the street you can take advantage of the public bike hire! So much to do and so little time...
1398616	48532029	42274	40647685	Greicy	Michael and Jackie were great! Michael was home to great us and so was their puppy. I am afraid of dogs but this one was really nice. He even wanted to play catch.  We spent most of the day outside and came home to a quiet and comfortable place to sleep.The Divi bikes were right outside their place. If you love to bike you can hop on as soon as you go outside and ride back and be steps away from their place. 
4257285	21315950	41926	22094537	Dustin	This was my first experience using airbnb, and I'm glad it was with Felice. She's interesting, a pleasure to be around, and was very accommodating to the agenda I had for the weekend. The space is beautiful and the neighborhood is very safe. Some things you should know about the place are that it's the third floor of building with no elevator and the bed in your room is a single, maybe a twin (I have a large bed at home so I don't really know). 
4257285	21633353	41932	4808382	Alex	This charming apartment was the perfect place for my brief return to the city I love. The whole place has a character that speaks of love and care; almost every aspect is either hand-crafted or hand-selected. The location was ideal: close to public transit but just off the beaten path.Felice herself is down-to-earth, low-key, attentive, and compassionate. I felt free to enjoy my stay in my own way without feeling ignored or neglected.Would stay here again in a heartbeat. Highly recommended for short or long stays in the Windy City.
4257285	23180442	41967	23614193	Yanru	Felice is a very nice householder and talented artist. I really love the decoration of the apartment which is so special and fantastic. The days living there make me so warm and get a deeply communication between different culture. So good!
4257285	23712876	41981	15153795	Christine	The Neighborhood was a quiet and safe neighborhood.  I felt completely safe walking down the street and around the corner, and down another street to my daughters apt. late at night. Felice made me feel very welcome and is very friendly and outgoing.  She stayed up late when my plane was delayed and I got to her apartment after midnight.  Even offered me a glass of wine. The apt. is very clean and neat with lots of terrific atmosphere.  There was lots of closet  and shelf space.  Nice fluffy towels, extra quilts and a firm bed
4257285	26447167	42048	195661	Eleanor	Felice is a warm and friendly host and her home is beautifully decorated with the distinctive style of an artist.  I stayed very comfortably in the small single room for a month.  There is a desk - perfect for my laptop work - and lots of closet space. A cozy spot to come home to after a day in the Chicago cold.  Felice offered lots of helpful information about shops and neighborhoods.  Grocery stores are a short walk away, as is the CTA station, and bus stops.   
4257285	28311607	42085	21402400	Mara	Felice was friendly and warm. She printed me out the bus and train routes to get me to where I needed to go early in the morning, pointed me in the right direction for good coffee (very important!) and did everything she could to make my time in Chicago satisfying - above and beyond what anyone could reasonably expect.Felice's place is beautiful. What a treat to be able to just hangout in a gorgeous old apartment. The bed was comfortable, the house was spotless and the neighbour felt very safe.Thanks!
4257285	33650619	42155	5168466	Leandra	I stayed with Felice for a little over two months during an internship and it was great. Felice is very welcoming, easy to talk to, and is 100% there to help you have a wonderful experience in Chicago. Her place is very charming and the neighborhood is nice and quiet. The location is incredibly convenient and close to a ton of public transportation options.
4257285	44752657	42245	24264278	Rachel	I had an absolutely lovely summer staying with Felice! Everything in the apartment is clean, comfortable, and very beautiful. I immediately felt right at home in the apartment, which is situated close enough to public transit that I could very easily commute into the loop daily. And Felice is such a warm, genuine person. Staying here was a simply a delight!
6312345	32615276	42143	32713526	Sunkyo	Elieen was awesome!! The neighborhood was safe and cozy. I had this home for my mom to attend my graduation and it was great place to trust my mom at. The place was easy to get around but it was a bit far from where my mom had to be at.
6312345	32789641	42145	5449644	Paul	Eileen was a fantastic host, I felt like she was my second mother with the comfort she gave me in her home.  She showed me around and made sure I was looked after.  :)
6312345	33735300	42155	3990698	Enrique	Eileen was an excellent host. My father was in town and I couldn't host him for a couple of weekends. She  hosted him and he really enjoyed his stay.
6312345	35107073	42170	12095783	Andrew	The host family was friendly, welcoming and accessible.  We enjoyed lively conversations with them, as well as their beautiful home, comfy guest space, and great location -- quiet street, but steps from the lake, public transportation, many restaurants and shops. 
6312345	36420342	42183	1976084	Jane	Eileen was out of town, but was very helpful and quick to respond over email and phone.  Eileen seem like the kind of host you'd want to help you in a new town.     The house is in a safe enough neighborhood but not 100% so I wouldn't walk around late late at night.  The house has very easy access to the lake, great for biking or running.  Grocery store is within 1 block or so.  Bus is within a block and the train is a bit further, but within walking distance.  House has 2 airbnb rooms, so an additional guest and you will share a bathroom.  Her husband is also in the house and sometimes the son (I did not see him).  Room is spacious, located on the 2nd floor.  For your belongings, you get 2 drawers, plenty of hanging closet space, no desk in room (just lap desk).  However, there is a desk and computer for your use in the office next to your room.  You get access to a small fridge to share by you and the other guest.  Comfortable bed.  The room appeared to be the former room of their son and/or daughter.  There is visible accumulation of dust and several dead bugs in the window sill and floor.  Overall, the place worked out for the price but if you're looking for spic 'n span, you may have to fork out a bit more $.   uberX was easy to get whenever I needed it.  For some reason none of my up to date apple devices could access WiFi.  Everyone else had WiFi access, so this is unexplainable, but they plan on changing internet provider so this may become a no issue.  Worst case, there is a computer in the office.  I saw a printer but I didn't use it.  Very nice couple.  Great host. 
6312345	39186928	42206	6557964	Marisa	The house was in a great neighborhood with a few convenience stores within easy walking distance and a Target within a slightly longer walking distance. Some restaurants and a coffee shop were near too. The train stops were also very accessible and I made use of the Divvy bike stations all around the city, including near the house. The bedroom was a good size and there was a small office with a computer and a mini-fridge, which was great for storing small bites. The wifi did not work and the shower was very small and slightly mildew-y (which Eileen did notice and had begun to clean while I was there). I met Eileen and her husband and son (and sweet dog!) all of whom were very friendly. My friends live right near her and I would stay there again. 
6312345	39885961	42211	37613053	Colleen	This was our first experience with Airbnb and Eileen made it very easy and comfortable for us. Her emails were speedy and thorough. She answered all of our questions and concerns and put us at ease. Her home is spacious and lovely and very quiet. We were able to spend the weekend with our son, daughter-in-law, and grandson without a lot of extra driving. The only downside is trying to find parking over the weekend. 
7264941	44675131	42244	39727955	Sara	Paul was a fantastic host.   The condo was perfect with an incredible view of the waterfront and downtown Chicago.  Our company had the rental for 4 weeks to accommodate  some franchise training for a couple of our managers.  This was a perfect solution for our company needs.  
7264941	47294283	42264	42610580	Isos	Had a great start and highly recommend this place.
7308653	44080076	42239	42265695	Ð’Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð»Ð¸Ð¹	The host canceled this reservation 33 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7308653	45856329	42253	38259837	Verena	It was fantastic to stay at Claudia`s and TimÂ´s apartment. Everything was just as described - only better! The guest manual was of great help and we would highly recommend to use the bike rental across from the apartment. Also, before and especially during our stay the communication with Tim was perfect. Definitely a great place to stay!
7308653	46066531	42254	11274212	Kevin	This is a great place with a great price.  Thanks guys
7308653	46537318	42258	5465069	Liam	Claudia and Tim were fantastic. Always just a text away and they were very helpful. They made the stay painless. Their apartment is fantastic. way better than the pictures show and is close to everything you need.  Next time I'm in chicago I'll be checking to see if their place is free. Will definitely recommend them and their place to friends.
7308653	46942802	42261	4633909	Riccardo	It was nice to stay at Claudia and Tim's place. Perfect for 3_4 people. The place was simple, clean and near to many restaurants. Communication was easy via text message and will just suggest to add a few blankets and a saucepan just in case the guest want to prepare something. I will really recommend it and go back again
7308653	47203521	42263	341797	Eric	yes it was. great location for wrigley. fun neighborhood for walking eating and have in fun. 
7308653	47751847	42268	42146098	Liam	We had a wonderful time During our stay in Chicago. The Apartment was everything they it said it would be. Claudia and Tim were excellent hosts, very accommodating.  What a great Neighborhood!!! So much to do and eat and so close to the mas transit lines! We would for sure stay in this wonderful apartment again.
7308653	48143013	42270	24139917	Bob	Claudia & Tim's apartment was great!  It is close to all the action on Clark Street, but just far enough away so that it is in a quiet neighborhood.  The apartment is bright and clean with a large bedroom, full kitchen, and very comfortable sofa-bed.  We were able to find parking in front of the building but there is also a parking garage just a few blocks away.  There are several grocery stores, bars, and restaurants close by.  The beautiful lakefront, Wrigley Field, and the L Train are just a few minutes walk.  Finally, Tim & Claudia were excellent hosts who responded within minutes to my questions.  We stayed to go to a Cubs game and will DEFINITELY stay again the next time we visit the North Side of Chicago.
7308653	48252571	42271	41495459	Derek	Tim and Claudia are great and their apartment is perfect. If you're looking for something simple in a great part of town, this up your ally. It's in a safe location- we felt totally at ease walking back from Wrigley field even though it was really late at night. The hosts were quick to respond to all of my communication, made it easy for me to get into the place and even helped me out when I had a last minute schedule adjust (my fault). Great place, great hosts. 5 stars all the way.
7308653	48347313	42272	3454563	Kenneth	T&C were helpful, responsive and full of good info.  The apt was in a great neighborhood near the Lake.  It was comfortable, functional, and they even left us a few beers and a nice bottle of red wine.
7092455	40370819	42215	29380122	Hannah	Rob was an excellent host. Apartment was great - cool neighborhood and easy access to the subway. Staying there made for an awesome trip!
7092455	40784644	42218	32642909	Barbara	The location is very well connected: in 3 minutes 2 CTA stop that in 30 minutes will connect you to the loop. The building is very  nice and safe with a gym and a barbecue area. Unfortunately we've found a couple of problems in the apartment and in the organization. The bedroom is not the one of the photos: there is not a regular bed with bed head and everything as reported, but only 2 mattress (very old and uncomfortable) on a bed base. In the house signs of a recent unfinished move. Moreover when we arrived Rob was very nice and kind but bed and bath linen were still in the washer (our check in time was exactly as planned). As a result we had to wait 2 hours to have linen dried and being able (after an intercontinental trip) to use the bath, take a shower, and, after having prepared our bed by ourself (of course with linen not ironed), finally take a rest. I think Rob needs to put a greater care in the organization of his place and welcome.
7092455	41112364	42220	14301129	Rebecca	Kind and generous hosts, great apartment, fantastic area. Would absolutely stay here again!!! Sad we were only there 2 nights.
7092455	41419657	42223	38093113	Carmen	Our experience was fantastic . The apartment is great. The building is very nice with a great patio we enjoyed very much. It is in a great area near restaurants and you can walk to the water . The gym in the building is really nice as well. Rob and his wife were super friendly and helpful. I highly recommend staying here!
7092455	41826746	42225	38939236	Joel	Everything was great. The location made access to the red line quick and easy. The building was clean and smelled nice. The unit was clean and simple. Communication with the host was easy and response was quick.  
7092455	42550125	42230	35441998	Jason	Rob met us upon arrival & gave a quick tour. He answered questions & made us feel really welcome. Rob is such a nice & friendly guy.The apartment was exactly as described & the bed in the den is very comfortable. Access to the building/apartment were easy & the tenants were always friendly. Lots of active people live here & the neighborhood is fabulous. This location provided excellent, quick & easy access to the Red Line, Foster Beach & great food. We loved the Thai recommendation Rob gave upon arrival. We met Missy as they were nice enough to bring an extra coffee mug to accommodate our needs. Both Rob & Missy are very friendly & excellent hosts. They were as engaging as we wanted & made us feel very welcome throughout our stay. Thanks for an awesome place to stay & enjoy Chicago!
7092455	43078765	42233	37837123	Nikki	Rob and his wife made us feel extremely welcome. They provided us with a packet of information describing the neighborhood with things to do, places to eat, things to see, and the best forms of travel for navigating the city. They left us their personal phone numbers in case we needed anything urgent.They also left us a personal note wishing us luck on the mud run we scheduled to participate in and encouraged us to use their washer and dryer after the race. The space was very clean. They provided a coffee maker and grounds, and beverages in the fridge. This was our first time using airbnb and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. 
7092455	43693413	42237	27786481	Matthias	Wonderful apartment just north of Chicagos downtown area. Nice neighbourhood and a Metrostation just around the corner. Rob was a very nice and caring host, I would stay here again anytime.
7092455	44308529	42241	5187337	Sarah	This listing is in the desirable Edgewater neighborhood, a short walk from the lake, the Red Line, and a bunch of great restaurants. Although the furnishings are a bit spartan, it is clean, convenient, and well-priced. Rob was responded to all of my emails very quickly. He greeted us at the apartment and was very friendly.  
7092455	44929572	42246	6457999	Kiera	"Rob was a great communicator through the whole experience. He's one of those people you meet and nod your head while saying ""that dude's a good guy."" It's true! Definitely one of the better airbnbs I've stayed in. He and his wife provided some basic creature comforts that helped my SO and me feel like we had a home away from home while visiting Chicago. The spot is super close to the Red line (seriously a couple of blocks to either stop) and walking distance to Andersonville. There are some great food options within 5-10 blocks, which was convenient since half of our plans were to eat through Chicago. Really nice neighborhood; lots of dogs to pet on the way to the Red Line. The building has a lot of pleasant people in it as well, all of our interactions were great and the apartment itself was super quiet and made it super easy to just rest after a day of hoofing around the city.Definitely book here if you're looking for a clean and convenient place to rest in a nice neighborhood with helpful hosts. Thanks Rob!"
7092455	45264775	42248	34172869	Derek	Rob is such a GREAT host. He was willing to wait for us after our flight time changed to very late night. We got lost and he even picked up up. The neighborhood was nice and close to stores. The red line was just two blocks away. The place was clean and very nice. Rob made us feel welcomed in the space so it was very comfortable. And what's more impressive was the supply of decorate it yourself ninja gingerbread cookies!! 
7092455	45502199	42250	3249750	Blanca	Rob was a very thoughtful host. He takes great care to ensure that the apartment is clean and welcoming to hosts, and to accommodate their needs whenever possible. I stayed there for two nights, and I could tell it would be a great place for tourists (location) looking for a safe, comfortable, clean environment.
7092455	45637197	42251	10686119	Jordan	Robb makes the experience easy for checking in and out. The location is ideal with easy access to Lake Shore Drive. The space is ultra comfortable for summertime with nice air conditioning. I would definitely stay again. 
7092455	46137928	42255	34989565	Jessica	As a female traveling alone with plans to do all sorts of touristy stuff, this fit my needs (and budget) exactly. Two blocks from CTA (and then about 30 minutes from downtown), a few blocks from the beach and nearby grocery stores, and deep dish, Chicago-style pizza within walking distance. The neighborhood is very safe and I was able to easily walk to and from the train station any time of day without concern. Rob was very communicative and was clearly interested in making sure I enjoyed my stay. 
7092455	46429793	42257	30739256	Sharun	I had a great experience staying at Rob's, he communicated in a timely manner and frequently checked to make sure I had everything I needed .The apartment is conveniently located 2 blocks from the train station with a 15 min ride to downtown. The apartment  is very clean and comfortable. parking is convenient once you figure out the one ways etc . I would  definitely recommend Rob as a host and probably come back the next time I am in Chicago .
7092455	46714972	42260	34129592	Fede	We didn't have the chance to meet Rob but he arranged everything perfectly for our stay. The appartament is lovely and suitable even for a big family like us. The neighborhood in which it is located is nice and quiet and we found Rob's suggestions about restaurants in the area really helpful. Our stay in Chicago couldn't have been better.
7092455	47045433	42262	34592866	John	Great experience. Very clean and private apartment. We had fun exploring that area before doing all the downtown touristy things. We recommend Tweet for breakfast. So good! Rob was nice and easy to work with. 
7092455	47226931	42263	3539328	Carly	Rob was very quick to respond and extremely helpful when we were trying to locate a place to stay while in the process of moving to Chicago. Unfortunately, our move was delayed and we had to change our travel plans since our furniture would not be arriving until later in the week. Rob was very understanding and thoughtful in his response. Although we didn't get to stay at Rob's place, we would recommend his place to our friends and family based on our interaction.
7092455	47261094	42264	39493363	Matt	Excellent experience!  Rob was very accessible and went out of his way for my wife and I during our stay.  The property is in an excellent location, spotless and comfortable.  We will look forward to our next trip back!
7092455	47407350	42265	2616345	Smiley	Great Location.  Really neat space and amenities.  Just like (website hidden) in the fridge.  Coffee Pot ready for in the morning.  What more could you want?
7092455	47968149	42269	37330447	Jon	Great experience, the apartment was exactly as described. 2 blocks to Red Line and another 2 blocks to some great spots on Clark, can't really beat it.Rob was a great host and very easy to communicate with about arrival instructions.
6622853	37499515	42192	35606675	Rick	"We had a wonderful time in Chicago and our stay at this property enhanced our visit.  It is on a beautiful tree-lined street about three miles from downtown.  Although our daughter and partner had a car we mostly walked and used the L.  We enjoyed learning and using the easy-to-use trains and buses.  Two different ""L"" stops are each about a 10 minute walk away (in different directions) and several restaurants are within an eight to 15 minute walk away.  There is no close grocery store but a large grocery store (Whole Foods) is about a 15 minute walk away. The unit is on the second story, in the back, of a three story brick town house and has access to a roof-top table and umbrella with a good view of the downtown skyline.  The unit is relative light and airy. We were the inaugural visitors to this property and our friendly hosts greeted us, left us a very nice bottle of wine, and gave us some tips about the area and the property.  The unit was very clean, attractive and well appointed.  The size of the space was adequate but not overly spacious for two adult couples.  The bed and fold-out sofa were comfortable."
6622853	39061716	42205	24826967	Donald	The condo was exactly as described.  Very modern, simple, clean and comfortable.  The neighborhood is great - safe, quiet - a really nice place to stay.  Lacey was a good host.  We had everything we needed.  I like the way she set things up:  everything went smoothly from reservation to check in/out.  We never actually met in person, but we didn't need to.  She explained it all very clearly and made things easy.A very good host.  I would absolutely stay there again.  
6622853	40167307	42213	38369309	Kathy	The apartment is in a great Lincoln Park location and was perfect for our visit with our two children who live in the area. The condo was clean, well-equipped and was accurately pictured and described by the the listing. Lacey provided detailed instructions which made finding the condo and checking in extremely easy and the off-street parking was an added bonus.We would definitely rent this condo again for future Chicago visits.
6622853	41615073	42224	34953080	Dan	Lacey's condo was perfect for our stay in Chicago.  Everything was as described and plenty spacious enough for our family of 4.  We found the condo clean and neat with amenities for our daily use.  The location is also excellent, just a short walk to Lincoln Park or the L-train to Downtown.  Rooftop has the best skyline view in the city!  We would absolutely stay here again!!
6622853	42146516	42227	26587115	Zachary	Me and the Group we had with us had a great time in this condo! Great area and great host! 
6622853	43639354	42237	6713095	Jacqui	The condo was perfect for our needs, 2 adults, 2 children. The location was v convenient and there was a beautiful skyline view from the roof deck. All was perfect. I would stay there again. Lacey was a v good host. She seems very organized and her email containing information on the condo and surroundings was very well laid out. Thanks Lacey. 
6622853	48398331	42273	35877451	Eileen	My 20 year old son and I had a wonderful time in Lincoln Park! Loved the tree shaded streets! The area is wonderful- close to restaurants, stores, parks, Divvy bike rentals- everything you need right there. Downtown Chicago was a quick 15 minute taxi or uber ride- my son even long-boarded down a few times. Lacey and Patrick were very welcoming (even carried my 84 lb suitcase up to the condo!) and responsive to any needs we had. The condo is well equipped, the bed comfortable, and a great couch that easily pulled out to a double bed- also very comfortable. The condo was quiet and the other residents we met were very nice and offered help if needed. I would recommend this condo and hope to come back in the future. Thank you Lacey and Patrick!
7402738	38972279	42204	38796977	Alex	It was a great stay for the guy's first time renting it out. You could tell he wanted to make sure his guests had enjoyable stay. 
7402738	39870133	42211	38969240	Shaun	The place was great and Philip was a fantastic host. The location is amazing, short walks & very cheap fares to so many great places. The house is very comfortable, trendy decor, all wanted amenities and very clean. And Philip went above and beyond to be a great host, beyond helpful. I will definitely be staying again.
7402738	40526321	42216	39308222	Maark	Phillip is a terrific host.  He was very easy to work with and super accommodating.The neighborhood was great.  Very safe with walking access to restaurants, shops and Chicago highlights (e.g., downtown, sports venues, the beach, etc.)It is a perfect place for a someone looking for a place to drop his or her bags while exploring Chicago.  While it wasn't ideal for my wife and six-month old, I appreciate how great Phillip was and the location of his apartment.My only major concern is a lack of street parking.
7402738	40676397	42217	39360049	Darrin	From the very beginning, Philip was a very accommodating host. He went above and beyond by coordinating an early check-in time that worked with our schedule.  He also provided an video detailing everything we'd need to know about his apartment. 
7402738	40817736	42218	10870349	Hannah	Great place on a really cute street! We were super close to the L and super easy to get around the city! Philip was a great host and made everything really easy. This is a great place to stay for concerts, and the street, although close to a lot of cool places, is super quiet and relaxing if you're looking for more of a relaxed Chicago stay. Whatever your trip has in store for you this place is very accommodating and we would have definitely loved to stay longer if we could! 
7402738	41832141	42225	16991232	Lauren & Sam	Great location! Walking distance to the train.  Very accommodating host - downloaded new movies for us to watch which was much appreciated. Excellent value for its location - this is an older apartment unit but worth it at this price for the 2 bedrooms. Enjoyed the YouTube welcome video!
7402738	43103580	42233	27626517	Lisa	Phil was a wonderful host who has created a lovely and comfortable apartment.  The furniture was sturdy and comfortable.  The best bed I've slept in while traveling.  I had the back bedroom which faces the L train tracks but there was no shaking and only minimal noise, especially at night since the train runs so much less then.  The neighborhood feels very safe and welcoming.The location was ideal as we were in Chicago for a comedy festival at iO just a 10+ min walk away! I would highly recommend this to anyone!  The area has wonderful coffee shops, restaurants and shopping within a short walk.Phil is a really responsive and accommodating host who got us an extra set of keys when we asked and had recommendations about the neighborhood.
7402738	44334788	42241	24238645	Kaley	Phillip is a great host. He was very accommodating. My parents flew in before the rest of the group and he made sure to let them in and show them around. The house has all the amenities and more. Very close to the L train and other shops. restaurants and bars. I will be staying here on my next trip to Chicago! 
7402738	45139971	42247	26764822	Vasile	Great location Furnishings were over stated not as nice as discribed no TV no A/C place was a little dirty especially the Fridge

1984545	33957850	42157	34126354	Kah Poh	Bobbie was very nice and attentive to details. She had small snacks and sandwich prepared for me. She was also very quick in responding (the curtain fell off and immediately she sent over her assistant to fix it). Great experience overall.

6710467	37208921	42190	35726936	Nonna	The appartement of Stephanie is very awesome and has much light. The hostess is very friendly, she even leaved the notes for us all over the place. I am allergic to cats, so Stephanie had made shure that the cat was locked in the separrate room. It's a pity that we couldn(t get in touch with Stephanie, because she is such an interesting ans positive person. We are looking forward towards our future arrival to Chacago, so we could rent a room in her appartement again.
7420482	39140465	42205	39016385	Candace	The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
7420482	42997594	42232	41272607	Duncan	Noah was a great host and enabled us to book the place last minute Great location and easy to get key 
8118084	45645883	42251	13019063	Manish	Kate is very sweet and welcoming. I had great time staying at her place. I was late from work and did not have dinner. She instantaneously offered me a ride in her new car to get some dinner. Kate had set up her place well and let the AC on in the room before I arrived. Cool and cozy room is the best you would want after a long tiring day. To relax after dinner, I sat to chat with Kate and her neighbor in her garden. Overall, it was a wonderful stay with Kate and her cute little dog.Thank you Kate for letting me stay at your place. I would love to come back here.
8118084	46567879	42258	43806483	Liz	Awesome location and beautiful garden to accompany a welcoming house and host. Kate was very attentive and friendly, always ready to help us out with whatever we needed. I would recommend! Thanks for a great stay, Kate!
8118084	47004593	42261	31243385	Leah	From the moment we pulled up, Kate was extremely welcoming! She made us feel more like friends than guests. Her place was so cute and we felt at home. It was so nice to have a place to come back to that wasn't a tiny hotel room. The next time I'm in Chicago I will for sure try and stay with Kate again!
8118084	47117498	42262	43537183	Clare	Kate is an absolute gem. She went out of her way to acommodate our whacky schedule all complicated by luggage and having been on the train for 20 hours.....Then Kate organised us both for our only day in Chicago...Lovely place with a LOVELY host at the centre of things. Thank You Kate, you made our Chicago Day !! 
8118084	48749659	42275	42913480	Alexandre	Nous avons passÃ© un excellent sÃ©jour Ã  Chicago pendant 2 semaines et avons rÃ©sidÃ© chez Kate. Elle nous a parfaitement accueilli chez elle et avons eu beaucoup de chance de l'avoir rencontrÃ©. La maison est propre et chaleureuse, la terrasse est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able.La station de mÃ©tro se trouve Ã  moins de 10 minutes Ã  pieds, et il faut environ 10 minutes pour accÃ©der au centre ville.Kate est une trÃ¨s agrÃ©able personne qui nous a beaucoup aidÃ© le long de notre sÃ©jour.( conseils, adresses, etc) et sa petite chienne est adorable.
8118084	48945594	42276	43131208	Shuguang	Kate is very hospitable, and I'll book her house next time.
8118084	49166287	42278	15977251	Elif	We had a very good time while we were staying with Kate. She is a really friendly and helpful host. The place was well decorated and the room was comfortable. We totally loved it. The room has its own place for luggage and clothes. We had our own private bathroom too. We did use the laundry as well which was quick and convenient. All things aside , Kate's puppy Mazie is also really cute. If we ever go to Chicago again, we would stay here for sure.
8210157	46244413	42255	42847297	Kyle	Great location, close to the El. Abby was awesome and helped with finding parking close by and any other questions we had! 
8210157	46976936	42261	43306489	Eric	Abbie had everything laid out and the place had been given a little makeover from the earlier pictures. Neighborhood is awesome with tons of stuff simply a short walk away. So happy I stayed at Abbie's place.
991809	3984881	41365	5336501	Jay	Preet was an amazing host. Easy going, responsive and helpful. Her place is perfect for a weekend or for a longer term. Close to public transportation, restaurants, bars and the highway. 10 minutes to anywhere downtown.Next time I need a place in Chicago, Preet's place will be on the top of my list!
991809	4420258	41398	710646	Eddie	Amazing apartment! Very cozy and modern. Best parts were the balcony and steam shower :D Great location, steps to UIC, trains, busses, 7-eleven, restaurants, shopping, etc. Preet was an amazing host. She was friendly, knowledgable, and great at communicating. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming to Chicago.
991809	4628925	41410	5270236	Luc	We spent a wonderful week in Preet appartment. It is very clean, well designed and very close to many activities. The bus stop is close and it's very esay to go anywhere. Preet is a very reliable host, very reactive andaccomodative. I would highly reccomand this appartment to anyone which would like to come in Chicago.
991809	4683171	41414	5972160	Monique	Preet was the perfect host!  She was very friendly and welcoming.Her apartment was very clean and just as described.  We felt very comfortable there.  The steam shower was a great asset.  The neighborhood is very safe and full of friendly neighbors.  There are many bars, restaurants, shops within walking distance.  Easy access to downtown and other areas of Chicago via convenient buses around the corner as well as the EL/Metra.We would be happy to stay at Preet's place again during another visit to Chicago!
991809	4901967	41426	5690298	Pallavi	Preet's place was wonderful: very clean, well stocked, and exactly what I was expecting from the pictures.  Preet was an AMAZING host!  She was very friendly, she always responded promptly and was very helpful with local information and things like that.  This was my first experience with Airbnb, and I couldn't have hoped for a better one!  
991809	4962909	41429	28862	Sarah	I went with a two other ladies from work for a quick girls weekend and Preet's apartment was a perfect for us! Exactly as you see in the images provided is what you see in person. Very comfortable apartment in a safe and accessible environment. Preet was such an accommodating host. We highly recommend staying here and Preet as your host!
991809	5131116	41439	2541172	Alexandre	Preet is an amazing host. Everything works perfectly and the apartment is just the right place to be in Chicago.

991809	5341300	41450	5045177	Jacqui	My boyfriend and I stayed in Preets appartment for a little over a week, and we had a really great time. The appartment is lovely; spacious, clean and very pretty. We really enjoyed the gym in the building and the steam shower! Preet was also a great host, she gave us lots of tips for the area and was really responsive. We used public transport to get into the city and it was very low hassle. We also enjoyed the restaurants and the bars in the area surrounding the appartment. Definitely reccomend!
991809	5485904	41457	5424157	Kristine	My husband, two kids and I stayed at Preet's loft for four nights. Preet was a great host! She was extremely accommodating and flexible - even arranging underground parking for us. She was attentive and always quick to respond. The building is nice and quiet with friendly neighbours. We loved the open concept and felt very comfortable in this neat and tidy unit. Gym and steam shower were a bonus!  The location was perfect for us - close drive to many of Chicago's attractions! We would definitely return to Preet's loft and highly recommend her to host your visit!
991809	5832962	41473	3527478	Nick	Loved staying at Preet's loft! The neighborhood is very friendly and quiet, and parking was never an issue. Tons of places to walk to within 10 minutes. The unit was clean, modern and we felt right at home. Preet was there to greet us and give us a quick tour, and was never more than a text away with suggestions and helpful answers whenever we needed. Will be back for sure! 
991809	6024684	41482	2971314	Andrea	"We stayed at Preet's condo for 4 nights in July during our summer vacation. The condo was perfectly placed in a safe, friendly neighborhood near public transportation to downton and other areas of Chicago.Communication with Preet was excellent. Preet was a wonderful host who was available by phone/ text/email if we had any questions or issues.Preet's condo was very comfortable, clean and spacious. We felt as if we were at home. We definitely recommend staying at the ""Light, Airy and Modern Loft"" to other Airbnb guests! We had  an excellent experience and would not hesitate to book this loft again!"
991809	6091158	41484	3281875	Abdel	Guys you need to book this place! It is such a cute and cool flat with everything you need! And very easy to get in to town. Even though busses are near, we just walked all the way downtown. More importantly, Preet was such a sweetheart! She answers emails within minutes and is a pleasant person to be around. She welcomed us with a big smile and a bag of chocolates! Come on! :D
991809	6173751	41488	6755608	Lara	Preet's place was amazing! Extremely clean and cozy, in a great location. The steam shower is just awesome. Preet was so friendly and helpful. My boyfriend were very late showing up and she was so understanding and sweet! I would 100% stay at her place again.
991809	6270145	41492	5523990	Kyle	Preet and her place are awesome! I highly recommend staying at Preet's, great location in a lovely city. We stayed there over the weekend and loved every minute of it. Don't even think twice about this one people, trust me!!!! 
991809	6381093	41496	7835550	Christina	Fantastic apartment. Listen to the other reviews; Preet is wonderful, the apartment is beautiful, and the location is amazing.A few things the other reviews haven't mentioned:*Preet has a lovely and varied collection of books. You will find something you'll love. *Street parking is relatively easy. It took 5-10 minutes a night to find a spot within 2 blocks of the apartment.*There is a Divvy bike rack within 3 blocks of the apartment. These bikes are $7 for 24 hours and you can easily use them to get downtown.*Many restaurants and a late-night convenience store are within 3 blocks. *A taxi to downtown is $10 from this location.*Little Italy and Little Mexico are within walking distance if you're fit.
991809	6459109	41499	5394356	Han	Preet's loft is the perfect little suite for visitors to the Windy City. You'll feel right at home while on vacation and the location is great. Walkable distance to downtown but also less than a $10 cab fare. If you're still not convinced, let me tell you about the bed which felt like a cross between cloud 9 and God's beard so expect some good shut eye. The host herself was a sweetheart and very prompt in email correspondence. Preet left some amazing recommendations based on our interests and has made my first experience with AirBnb an undoubtedly pleasant experience.Her place is literally equipped with everything you need so just pack a bag and book already!
991809	6655916	41506	6721526	Katherine	Preet was very helpful and accommodating, even though our arrival plans were delayed.  The apartment is lovely and is well furnished.  I would advise guests travelling by car to request visitor parking passes from Preet in advance.  We had a terrible time trying to park as the surrounding area is labelled as resident-only parking.  The closest I was able to park during our entire stay was over 5 blocks away.  This was probably due to the time of year - UIC students are moving into their accommodation and the area was flooded with visitors.  I would stay again at Preet's apartment - without hesitation....I would just ask for a parking pass in advance!!  :)
991809	6738898	41509	6755963	Philipp	Preet is a very nice and very uncomplicated host.Everything was better than we expected. Her condo is lovely and clean. We immediately felt like home. We highly recommend to stay at her place if you are in the chicago area.
991809	6813148	41512	5737845	Chris	This is a really smart, clean and well proportioned apartment. My Wife and I visited Chicago for the first time with our 12 year old daughter and this was a great base. It's not in the center, and a bus/cab ride is required to get to wherever we wanted, but the bus system is easy, and the nearest stop is very close. Although the apartment overlooks the South Side, we were far enough removed to feel totally safe. The neighboring buildings are all very smart and most are part of the University, so there is no sense of feeling cut off. There is a supermarket nearby, although we ate out each night, than picked up a few items for breakfast on the way back. The shower takes a while to warm through but is worth the wait. The bedroom is comfortable, but anyone much larger than a 12 year old may struggle to get a good nights sleep on the sofa. We particularly loved having breakfast at the Island in the kitchen and looking out over the South Side. It's not like looking at the Grand Canyon but has a beauty all of its own. We had a couple of questions and Preet was always on hand to give advice. We couldn't get the TV to work and Preet was around to fix the problem, although in truth we listened to our iPod via the docking point on Preets system mostly. Preet is the perfect host, and we have no hesitation in recommending this apartment.
991809	6911917	41516	5331479	Fabian	it was great staying at your appartment. it is very beautifully decorated, the rooms were clean & the kitchen well equiped. the apartment was also located ideally since it is easy to get to the loop/downtown. thanks for being a great and helpful host! we would come back again!
991809	7083757	41522	8479856	Andreea	We came to Chicago for a weekend, and since hotels prices were crazy we looked for something more affordable. Preet's apartment is  comfortable, clean in an excellent location, and Preet was the perfect host, making sure we have everything. I definitely recommend staying at her place.
991809	7167001	41526	4820601	Ivan	Preet was very nice and the loft was spectacular. It was easy to use public transportation that was near it and overall it was money well spent. If i ever visit Chicago again I will def. want to stay at Preet's loft again 
991809	7240815	41530	3461903	Barbara	Preet is a great host... tha apt is wonderful, in a beautiful building.. when you stay there you feel like at home.. clean and airy... Bus station is really close.. Preet is very gentle, she gave us some information about chicago.. I raccomande her :)
991809	7413170	41536	7534594	Chris	Preet is awesome, first off! She was very accommodating to us for checking in and checking out with our flight schedule. Now... the place. How cool is this place?!?! We loved it. The bed was comfy, things were clean and ready for us. We had everything we needed to make meals in the apartment if we decided to not go out. We had breakfast a couple times too. The shower is amazing. It was really hard to get out of it at times. There is a secure entrance downstairs and everything felt nice and safe. The location is only a block or so from the nearest bus stop. We figured out the bus system super quick. The area has a lot of cool shops and restaurants. If you are in to wine, check out Lush, right down the street and see Anita, she is an expert. There is a train stop right behind the building, but it was not a bother at all.   I would definitely stay here again! Thanks so much Preet!
991809	7666329	41546	7358733	Summer	Preet was very nice to work with, and the space is very nice and a close cab ride from everything you'd want to see. 
991809	7781517	41549	2949745	Derek	The reservation was canceled 36 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
991809	7847612	41553	4906675	Felica	This was our first experience with Airbnb and it couldn't have been better! Preet was a wonderful host, she was very welcoming and friendly. The communication with her was very prompt. She gave us some very good recommendations about Chicago and the very close neighborhood. We stayed in her apartment for one week, it was very clean and well designed - from the first moment we felt comfortable. The neighborhood is safe and just around the corner is the next bus stop, so it was easy to go anywhere we want to. We definitely recommend staying at her place!
991809	7950148	41556	8784742	Gina	Preet was a great host. She is very pleasant and accommodating. It was the first time trying AirBnB. We were very pleased with accommodations and would highly recommend staying here on a trip to Chicago.
991809	8109532	41563	6437980	Louisa	Preet's apartment is really lovely, clean and tidy, with great transport via bus to the L and into downtown Chicago. I'd happily stay here again

991809	8525511	41582	8968329	Michael	Nice spacious flat that was very easy to use. Good location for getting into the centre of Chicago.  Preet was very helpful and responsive to any needs. Enjoyed my stay!
991809	9587973	41642	3706821	Rachael	Preet was a fantastic host. Her apartment is lovely and in a great area for getting around Chicago.  Preet was contactable whenever we needed her and ready and willing to help. We couldn't have felt more welcomed or enjoyed our stay more. I highly recommend staying here.
991809	10759344	41704	8902958	Imeleta	Preet was a fantastic host! She was informative and very forthcoming when asked questions, even emailing my sisters and I to see how our flights were going; an all round nice gal. Her place was lovely and very modern and the location was also a bonus. My sisters and I loved our stay at Preet's place, making our first trip to Chicago even more memorable. We hope to visit soon. Thanks Preet :)
991809	11129880	41720	10084902	Lulee	Preet was a wonderful host! She responded to all my inquiries very quickly with very helpful manner. She even offered help even before I requested.The place was also great. Beautifully decorated modern place with full of art books and novels. Kitchen, bathroom and washing unit was perfect as well.The neighborhood was quite and safe area right next to UIC campus. All places were within 30 min of reach and there were convenience store and good restaurants in walking distance as well.I would definitely stay at Preet's place again if I get to visit Chicago again!
991809	11363817	41729	12810175	Fran	Preet is just awesome!Her apartment is wonderful and clean. She has fresh sheets and towels available and her apartments is really close to downtown. We love the view!We cooked at her place. Everything went smooth and well.Thanks Preet!
991809	11590270	41737	9612997	Angelina	Preet's apartment was lovely, I couldn't recommend it more. The only thing to note is that if you are a light sleeper, you may hear the trains go by outside and the heater made a slight ticking sound. Other than that, the apartment is close to public transportation, the kitchen is so convenient, and the steam shower is a wonderful bonus. Preet was a gracious host, we had a perfect stay.
991809	11689425	41741	12030018	Ryan	This was my first Airbnb booking, but definitely one that set the bar for any others to follow. Even from the preliminary process, Preet was consistent in her communication with my wife and I, and availed herself to any questions or support we needed before and during our stay. Her place deeply impressed me with its well-traveled Ã¦sthetic, up-to-date amenities, easy accessibility, great book selection, and the ever-so surprising steam shower. My wife and I cannot thank Preet sufficiently for shaping our honeymoon into a concretely blissful experience.
991809	12647585	41765	15023730	Lida	This the furst time we booked with Airbnb and sets the bar for others, Preet is a wonderful oerson, very helpful, conmunicated with us throughtout our stay.  The place was wonderful, clean, modern.  Although we did not use the kitchen at all, but is completely furnished, the Bathroom is perfect. I wiuld definitely rent ut bext time I am in Chicago.
991809	13722163	41792	16022859	Divya	As a first time user of airbnb, I was extremely satisfied with my stay over at Preet's. She is a great host. She shared all the right information I needed to reach her place and guided me wherever I needed help. Her apartment is super comfortable and maintained so well - it has a clean and well accessorized kitchen, the bed is super comfy. The apartment is easily accessible and is not too far from downtown and there are bus stops very close to the place. I highly recommend Preet to anyone who is looking for a comfortable stay in Chicago. I thoroughly enjoyed my first experience with airbnb and I am definitely now a loyal customer.
991809	14704211	41814	16068687	Jason	Preet was a great host. The apartment was just as pictured and really nice accommodations. The apartment is in a great location. I could easily hop on the bus to get to the Loop. I utilized the nearby bike share as well. Preet was very responsive and provided me with tips on where to eat and how to get around. I will be looking her up again when I visit Chicago. 
991809	15144721	41823	13007535	Laura	Preet's place was lovely and Preet was easy to communicate with. She always got back to me within the same day and answered all my questions. Preet was traveling so her boyfriend, James let us into the apartment. James was very friendly and accommodating as our plane arrived late at night and he had to wait for us to arrive. He was kind enough to give us dinner suggestions and other places to go in the neighborhood.  Preet provided us with K-cup pods and allowed us to use her machine (life saver in the morning!) and her place was very tidy. There are the railroads are right behind her place but hardly any trains run at night and it never woke me up (and I'm a very light sleeper). I would definitely recommend her and her place!
991809	15400178	41828	4001358	Nancy	Preet's Loft was just as pictured and very comfortable. Her balcony turned out to be a great place to see nearby July 4th fireworks without having to fight the Navy Pier crowds. The loft is a short hike from Ping Tom park where we were able to take the Water Taxi into downtown and rent kayaks as well. Our stay was completely trouble-free. Preet is a great host.
991809	16128716	41842	17444677	Fouad	This was my first time using airbnb.  I was traveling with my wife and we loved the apartment and Preet was a great host. Preet was very responsive, helpful, and replied to our messages quickly.  She was very accommodating with requests.  The apartment is very cozy, clean and fully furnished (there's even a steam shower). She provided fresh sheets and towels for us.  It's in a great location, very close to public transportation, the highway and downtown.  The area is nice and safe.I would recommend Preet and her apartment to anyone looking to stay in Chicago.
991809	16312617	41845	3545016	Iddo	Great place - had a lovely stay at Preet's
991809	16482821	41848	17075975	Mike	Had a great time at Preet's condo in Chicago. Really convenient and modern, but comfortable.
991809	18481907	41878	9670809	Elena	We had a great stay at Preet's apartment. The apartment is compact but has almost all the necessary amenities. Preet was easy to communicate with before and during the stay and checked up on us to make sure everything was going smoothly. The apartment is about a 20 minute walk to the L but there is a bus out front as well. It's about a 15 minute cab ride to the Loop. It certainly helped us have a great trip to Chicago. Thanks!
991809	18917243	41884	17771570	Khizer	"Bright, Airy and Modern as described! Me and my girlfriend stayed at Preet's for 5 nights. We had no issues staying at this clean & well equipped apartment. * apartment: The highlight of this apartment is the Steam Shower. It is super easy to operate & works great! The tall windows bring so much light into the apartment. Most of our stay we had the blinds down since it was making the apartment warm! We didn't cook at all (other than making some tea) but we saw that it has everything you need to cook/bake.  Only thing was that there is no ""room"" since the bedroom does not have a door or the walls fully enclose the area. This was not an issue with us but something to note.* location: This apartment is right in the University Village. The area is quiet, lots of students around, bus stop 1 block away. It was very easy to get to anywhere and it is right off of one of the major street so very convenient. * security: Someone was always at the front door, either doorman or office person during the regular business hour. The area is really nice and quiet and we felt secure and at home."
991809	19269119	41891	17956176	Alison	Preet absolutely made us feel welcome. Very clean, neat, and in a quiet area. She was extremely prompt in answering any questions and accomodating to our arrival time.  
991809	20522850	41912	3484713	Vu	Preet's place felt comfortable and safe with a security guard on the bottom floor.  The residence is approximately 10 minutes away from downtown and other popular restaurants.  Preet responded back immediately when questions where asked.  I would definitely stay here again.
991809	20677396	41915	2324410	Yvonne	My friend and I booked last minute with Preet and she was beyond accommodating. Her place was perfect for our 3-day getaway and she was super helpful and always in communication. We really enjoyed our time in Chicago and would love to stay here again in the future! 
991809	21331485	41927	12591354	Jordan	We had an amazing experience at Preet's loft and in the city of Chicago! The space was clean and lovely, and it had everything we needed for a pleasant stay. We relied exclusively on public transportation during our time in the city and had no trouble at all. The loft is located in a picturesque neighborhood near UIC. We walked all over the city and neighborhood and felt safe everywhere we went. After long days of sightseeing it was always so pleasant to come back home to the loft. Preet was extremely helpful and responsive throughout the entire process. She provided useful suggestions in the time leading up to our trip, and she responded immediately to any emails we sent during our stay. We would definitely recommend this to anyone visiting Chicago!
991809	22041056	41940	22460761	Laura	"Just returned from five days of staying at Preet's loft in Chicago. It was the perfect location for us, a young couple looking to stick to a budget without sacrificing quality. Preet's apartment was spacious, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. It did not feel like your typical ""one bedroom"" space. The 8th floor view was pretty nice, too. The bed was very comfy; the mattress topper, pillows and comforter were truly inviting to rest and were key in our recovery after long days sightseeing Chicago and Milwaukee. The steam option in the shower was amazing! We had a car while we were there and had no issues whatsoever finding free, nearby parking (16th St. or Halsted). We took the metro the first day there but preferred driving overall - in any case, location was great. Tons of restaurants nearby with great Mexican influence. We felt safe at all times, even walking at night. Security in the building offered peace of mind. Preet was very helpful and responsive whenever we needed her. Would definitely recommend!! "
991809	22660934	41954	19202499	Beau	Preet was very easy to communicate with.  She answered all our questions promptly.  The loft was cozy and clean.  We felt very welcomed the moment we walked in.  Preet gave clear instructions on where to park and how to access the loft.  The neighborhood felt safe and we had no issues with the building.  The concierge was friendly and accommodated any inquiries we had.  We highly recommend Preet as a host.
991809	23248144	41969	23154102	Josh	Preet's apartment was absolutely beautiful. It was exactly as described and pictured. My girlfriend and I spent four days and three nights at the apartment. It is located in the University of Illinois, Chicago area, with plenty of restaurants and sights to see in the area. The train and bus systems are close by as well, and Uber and taxi services were not terribly expensive either. We visited the restaurant side of town (about a 25 min walk) which housed many of the highly rated restaurants around Chicago. The downtown area was not difficult to travel to either, which had plenty of beautiful bars and hotspots. Preet's apartment was a perfect corner getaway from the commotion if needed, and right near the action if wanted. I would definitely stay again and can't wait to return to chicago!
991809	23455596	41974	16345693	Moritz	My friends and I definitely enjoyed our stay at Preet's apartment. She was very accommodating and made us feel welcome. The apartment itself was cozy, fancy and in a safe and quiet neighborhood. I'll give my very best recommendations for Preet and her apartment.
991809	24252502	41996	23570088	Stacie	Preet's place is clean, stylish, safe, and in a great location. I especially liked that there is a doorman or security guard on site 24:7. The view is amazing and it takes no time at all to get to the downtown area and other areas of Chicago. Checking in was very fast as her boyfriend James was on hand to help out when I arrived and even gave suggestions about bars. Checking out was also a breeze. I thoroughly enjoyed the condo and she is a great airbnb host no doubt. Definitely book this place if you want a weekend getaway! 
991809	24869313	42007	24652795	John	Preet was an amazing host and very easy to get a hold of through email and text messaging if we had any questions about our stay. This was my first Air BnB stay and I could not be happier with our stay in Chicago at Preet's place. Her place is exactly as described and the indoor parking onsite was very helpful. From the minute we (my girlfriend and I) first made contact with Preet, everything was easy and her boyfriend James met us to give us the keys as we arrived. We loved Preet's place, especially the kitchen! We would definitely recommend Preet's place to anyone heading to Chicago for a visit.
991809	25115226	42010	4104687	Karlyn	Great place to stay in Chicago!  The location was very convenient and it was really nice to have a gym in the building to get some running in even when it was freezing outside.  Thanks for your hospitality! 
991809	28496360	42087	29272515	Chase	This was our first airbnb experience and it was very pleasant! Preet was very good at communicating with us promptly, her place was nice and she made sure we had everything we needed. Thanks!
991809	29813248	42107	16354207	Bryan	Preet was a very accommodating host.  She quickly answered any questions we had, and the loft was clean and comfortable.  The concert we saw at Thalia Hall was an easy walk.  This is a great location if you want to spend time in University Village or Pilsen.  Thanks for hosting, Preet!
991809	30075092	42111	19236155	Katie	Preet's apartment was absolutely lovely -- very clean, beautifully-decorated and had everything you could possibly need (and yes, I NEEDED that steam shower). Having a gym in the building was crucial, although if you are a runner, it's an easy route to get down to the running paths along the lake. This is the perfect place to stay if you have a conference at McCormick -- it's a very quick uber ride to the conference center, and just a 10-buck ride into the loop for events. Great for an extended stay -- easy access to Whole Foods and other necessities. I was here for four days and by the end, felt like I just lived in Chicago! 
991809	30388703	42115	28404086	Cherish	Preet made it easy to contact her if needed.  Good location of the loft, just less than a mile and a half from The Loop and major tourist attractions.  Clean, quiet, place and the steam shower is great.
991809	30861907	42122	15752627	Mike	Preet is a great host and her apartment is an excellent place to stay. I highly recommend it. It's very spacious, as described and very comfortable. Preet was quick to answer any questions I had and always on call if I needed any help with the flat. 
991809	31165618	42127	1376440	Matthew	The place was great for what I needed. It's nice with a modern open feel. You have a balcony with a pretty expansive view. Could walk to UIC where my conference was. The train tracks are super close which could bother a very light sleeper, but I am one myself and the sound proofing made it fine for me. Preet and I never actually met but she set everything up and was very helpful over text. 
991809	31580646	42131	23723502	Mo	Preet was an extremely welcoming host. Upon arriving in Chicago she texted me to make sure we landed safely, confirmed arrival time to her place and offered to give us recommendations for things to do throughout the city. The loft was exactly as advertised: bright, airy, and modern. The neighborhood is quiet and only 10-15 minute car ride from downtown Chicago, depending on where you want to go. Additionally, there are plenty of food options on the main street one block from the loft. I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a place to crash in the Windy City!
991809	32187003	42139	31667722	Amanda	Preet was super responsive to all our messages and accommodating when our train was unexpectedly delayed. We loved this very private and secure loft and I especially enjoyed choosing a read from the small but well curated book selection--an unexpected bonus! The bed was super comfy and the steam shower very relaxing. There was train noise, but it didn't bother us. We were able to walk many places--very nice neighborhood-- and enjoyed picking up supplies from Whole Foods. Would definitely stay here again.
991809	32680348	42144	28714618	Frances	Beautiful and inviting home! Preet was an amazing host and was always available if needed. Her apartment was homey and comfortable. The neighborhood is great and within walking distance to a few shops/restaurants. Perfect distance away from the city (easily accessible yet far enough away to relax and get away from the hustle and bustle). I am definitely going to recommend Preet's home to all of my friends and family planning to visit the Chicago area!
991809	32890650	42147	29053034	Neftali	This was my very first time at an airbnb location; needless to say, I was a bit skeptical and was concerned about checking in, response time to questions during my stay, etc, etc.  I look back and now feel silly about my concerns. First of all, Preet's loft is amazing, it's clean, comfortable, super safe, there is a security guard in the lobby and the location of her loft is easily accessible and it's located in the university village at UIC.  Preet and James are excellent hosts.  Checking in was so easy, any questions I had were quickly answered, James gave me tons of information about the neighborhood, restaurants, points of interest and even pointed out some of his favorite restaurants.  My wife and I are coming back to Chicago soon and we are planning to stay here again.  This property needs to have a 5 star rating!
991809	33576924	42154	25760222	Mallory	We loved our stay in Chicago and at Preet's apartment! The apartment is in a nice quiet neighborhood with easy access to several CTA lines. The building was quiet, with a nice gym and a pleasant security guard. Preet and her boyfriend, James, were wonderful hosts! They held our luggage before check-in and after checkout, and offered tons of great suggestions. They were always available for questions. Between all the walking we did and Preet's super comfy bed, I slept like a rock every night. I highly recommend this booking!
991809	34733946	42166	5160295	Syn Dee	I was traveling with my parents and wanted a place not too far off from the city and found Preet's place. The apartment is located in a pretty peaceful, modern neighborhood, with access to the building restricted to only people with a keycard. Upon arrival, Preet was already waiting and ready to assist us, especially with the amount of luggage we had! Check in was super fast as she gave us a brief overview of the unit and kept in constant contact throughout our stay to make sure everything was alright and to share tips of getting around the city. The apartment was pretty sound proof and we barely noticed the sound of the trains during the stay.I would recommend staying at Preet's! 
991809	34940813	42169	26895440	Liam	Very easy check in with James. He directed us and stayed late to help us find the apartment. The apartment is well located and everything is exactly as described. It's a very clever use of space and was perfect for us to begin our Route 66 road trip! Thanks Preet and James! 
991809	36540425	42184	33079960	Jennifer	We had a great time staying at Preet's AirBnB. The apartment is beautiful with great natural lighting. Everything was spotless and neat.  The heating/cooling system is nice and quiet. There is a ceiling fan for air circulation. You can hear the train go by once in a while but it didn't bother me. Check-in was so easy with Preet. She was flexible about the time and recommended things to do in the area.The neighborhood is ideal if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city areas. There are great local eateries nearby. I can't compliment Kristoffer's cafe and bakery enough. We went there 4 times in 2 days.  There is also a small farmer's market nearby on Sundays. The area is quiet and pleasant. 
991809	37052705	42189	32774078	Brandon	Preet was there to meet us when we arrived and showed us around. The loft was a great space and had everything we could possibly need. Just a couple blocks from a lot of great restaurants in the University Village area and easy transportation up north with buses. Preet made sure to be in contact throughout our stay to make sure we had what we needed. Definitely would recommend it!
991809	37441221	42192	1292345	Erin	From the moment we booked, Preet was very communicative and helpful. She was also available to answer any questions we had throughout our stay.  The Loft is exactly as described in the listing. Very comfortable and homey. We paid a little extra for the convenience of having a parking spot in the attached garage and it was well worth it.  The place was clean and quiet (except for the occasional rumble of a train going by) The bed was cozy and the shower had lots of water pressure.  The loft was very close to downtown but the neighborhood was lovely and we felt very safe. If we find ourselves back in Chicago, this loft will be our first choice to stay. 
991809	38991831	42205	20412145	Ian	Preet was a great communicator. She got in touch with me right from the get-go. She made sure my stay was comfortable and I was well taken care of. 
991809	39480923	42209	29815994	Elizabeth	We loved Preet, her home and the neighborhood. Preet quickly responded to any questions that we had prior to our visit. She greeted us warmly when we arrived and answered all our questions. Her home is lovely. We especially enjoyed the view! It was the perfect place to stay during our visit to Chicago and uberX helped us to get around town quickly. Of course, there is the train and bus, too. We think that the highest compliment we could give is that we would definitely stay in Preet's condo again, and we would recommend it to our friends and family.
991809	39907717	42212	28373048	Bruce	Nice clean place and neighborhood. Preet was professional and hospitable, everything went smoothly  
991809	40202537	42214	29966652	S	Unfortunately, I wasn't able to meet Preet, but she had a friend meet us with the keys. She was very easy to get in touch with and flexible. Her home was clean and very comforting. Although there is a train station right outside, the apartment was soundproof! The neighborhood was pretty quiet. Jim's Original, Joy Yee, and Mario's Italian Lemonade are all very closeby which was awesome since I had them listed on my list of places to try. 
991809	41062720	42220	29871687	Katie	Preet was a fantastic host and went out of her way to accommodate my party. Her apartment is clean, has a great view, and very welcoming security guards.
991809	41800369	42225	37827750	Adriana	Comfortable apartment and Preet is a very accommodating  host.Thank you Preet!
991809	42783927	42231	15233702	Jimin	Preet was very responsive and the whole process from request to check out was smooth as can be. Her place is really stylish and conveniently located near downtown and offered nice views of the city. I'd recommend!
991809	43396695	42235	38776858	Cheryl	This was our first Airbnb experience and Preet's place was everything we expected and more.  Preet was very helpful, kind, and considerate.  She met us to hand over the keys and walked us through her home to make sure we felt comfortable before she left.  She gave us fantastic food recommendations and was accessible by text/email throughout our stay.  Her home was comfortable, had a great view, and was close to excellent restaurants and shopping.  The neighborhood has a great vibe (not crowded like downtown) and the trains did not interfere with our sleep.  You can walk to many delicious restaurants.  The building is quiet and secure. At Preet's, you are close to the fun while enjoying a relaxed neighborhood upon your return from the day's activities.  We rented a car but Uber can get you wherever you need to go if you want an alternative to public transit.  Thanks, Preet, for making our trip all the better!
991809	45050320	42246	593143	Daniel And Meghann	The host canceled this reservation 68 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
991809	45119537	42247	19533374	Lucy	The host canceled this reservation 62 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
991809	45293127	42248	7614689	Abby	Preet was a magnificent host. I never met her in person as she was away in Mexico but she clearly communicated the check-in procedure and provided all info on the area, eateries, etc. If you want to experience Chicago as a real resident, her area is perfect. The area is near university village and a lot of great Greek, Italian and Mexican restaurants. Reminded me of certain areas of BK, and liked the more residential feel of her building vs. a more touristy locale. That said, she's right near public transport and anything is within 10-15 min cab ride. Kitchen well-equipped and apartment is very cute as well. 
991809	47031162	42262	29468927	Justin	Preet wasn't able to meet us to exchange the keys so her friend Uzo met us instead.  He was a very nice guy who showed us into the apartment and gave us some tips about the surrounding area.  The apartment is located right off of UIC's campus but it is super quiet at night, which is great for sleeping.  The area felt very safe and it was within walking distance to to the blue line and even further.  We walked to dinner on Randolph street one night since it was only about a 2 mile walk.The view in the evenings is nice from the balcony off the back of the apartment.  Although it doesn't face the center of the city, the southern portion of the city is very quaint as the sun is setting.Overall a nice place to stay.
991809	48330471	42272	30181725	Saurabh	Great place. Lovely host. Convenient location. Quiet and peaceful stay. I could not have asked for more. This was my first airbnb stay and I loved it thoroughly. Preet, my host, was awesome! Definitely coming back.
8266049	47820070	42268	376594	Shishila	Firstly, I wish we can keep Monica's place a secret. Because it is beyond amazing. The views are magnificent, and the apartment  gorgeous and very well kept. It is a 39 floor condominium facing Lake Michigan with the Navy Pier and Chicago's skyscrapers over yonder. It comes with very good security ,friendly doormen and in-house valet parking. There is laundry on the 4th floor, and supermarkets are very close. Halal food (for Moslems) was just a few blocks away, some open 24 hours a day. Lakeshore beaches, public parks, tennis lawns, and restaurants are all close. Biggest perk, You get to watch the sunrise every morning. The apartment is well equipped with all the modcons- dishwasher, flatscreen tv, free WIFI, stove, everything you think you need to be comfortable. As a host Monica was more than gracious, stocking the fridge with eggs, fruits milk and juice because our flight landed in the morning. She was also concerned with our wellbeing and kept in touch in case we needed anything. I'm so worried about keeping the apartment as clean as we found it, what with the family and all..and I hope we didn't do too badly. This was a gem, a true find, and I have nothing but the most glowing references to give. Thank you Airbnb and thank you Monica! 
8266049	48775759	42275	41628611	Calli	It was wonderful! The apartment has an amazing view. Close to the heart of the city, clean, cozy and spacious!
8266049	49149050	42278	10900642	Maleeah	"Monica has a wonderful place that she is willing to share to others. Although my colleague and I only spent two evenings in her ""escape on top of the world"", we greatly enjoyed the accomodations and the quick access to downtown Chicago. I greatly appreciated her willingness to communicate to make sure that our needs were met. I will definitely reccomend her place to others!"
3994828	27729439	42073	27713867	Krispin	The condo was perfect for a family looking to vacation in Chicago--very spacious, a perfect place to recoup. The neighborhood was very cool and interesting, not too gentrified, and we felt like it was only 5-10 minutes away (by car) from everywhere we wanted to go. Having a parking space was also a bonus! It was very much like staying in someone's house--way better than paying money for a hotel.
3994828	38832234	42204	31750434	Lisa	Ellen was a FANTASTIC host, she left us some beverages when we arrived. She was very responsive to my texts and did check in on me while I was there. Being a native of Chicago, the location of this condo is great, close to everything from the expressway, buses and trains. The condo is very spacious, lots of room. Ellen was very nice in allowing us to use her kitichen. The unit was clean when we arrived. No issues at all, only issue will be now that I have left this review, the next time I travel this place might be booked.  I would definately stay in this condo again if I'm visiting Chicago. 
7053864	39708471	42210	14271019	Tania	Kimberley was a very kind and accommodating host. Her apartment is very tidy and clean. The room is exactly as shown and the bedsheets were very soft. I would definitely stay here again if I visit Chicago!
7053864	40267006	42214	1655112	Jacob	Kimberley was very accommodating and eager to help me get settled into my room. She even lent me quarters to do laundry! (There is a laundry room in the apartment complex.)The room itself was part of a 3-bedroom unit, with 2 bathrooms and a nice living room and kitchen. It was quite spacious and a very comfortable temperature even though Chicago itself can get quite hot. The neighborhood is also quite convenient: just a block away from the university (though note that the university is big, so depending on where exactly you want to go it may be further).If I visit University of Chicago in the future, I will likely try to stay here again.
7053864	42100392	42226	21689538	Daniella	Kimberley's description of her apartment is accurate: it is a modest but nicely located place in the University area of Chicago, south of downtown (public transit access is pretty easy!). Kimberley herself is very nice: she was responsive to my messages and she helped us in any way she could, gave us instructions about subway access and tips about where to get the best deep dish pizza. Also we had a nice chat with her on the morning of our departure from Chicago. I'd stay here again if I were to visit Chicago again!
7053864	47854362	42268	43880078	Robert	Kimberley was a wonderful host.  The room looked exactly as advertised.  The place was well kept. No noise for neighbors.  Kimberley graciously switched on the air conditioning as soon as I arrived.  I would stay here again.
6629398	35014104	42169	265156	Tim	Apartment has door men (and women) who are very helpful.Short walk to Miracle Mile.Newer building.Great place.Friendly host.Top floor.
6000869	32002737	42136	13388493	Allison	Wesley and his boyfriend were so nice and great hosts! The apartment was very clean, modern and has great amenities. The Neighborhood is also great, fun bars, restaurants and a whole foods down the street. Great place to stay overall! 
6000869	33842502	42156	33387074	Rebecca	Wesley and Conrad were great hosts!  They explained everything accurately and have a great place in a convenient location.  
6000869	37378236	42191	34674646	Fon	This is a truly great place in a lovely neighborhood. The hosts could not have been more accommodating, professional, or gracious.  We had very high expectations and all were exceeded. 
6000869	42161998	42227	36373464	Efren	Great location, friendly guys and a very comfortable place to stay. I would recommend this place anytime. 
6000869	47757264	42268	41725751	Michael	Wesley's place was great! It is in a great location. We walked to wrigley in about 20 mins. The patios on both sides were nice, especially when it rained on one and not the other. Everything was clean and the keys were easy to pick up and drop off.
696395	5214609	41443	6369342	Mike	Excellent room! Christy was out of town when we stayed but made every arrangement for us. A terrific experience, especially for first-time AirBNB users. And the pets were so nice! We'd definitely stay here again when we come back to Chicago.
696395	5768379	41470	3323054	Michal	We loved the room and the location was great.
696395	10826190	41707	12551687	Jean-Christophe	Christy is an amazing host, and her place is a gem for cinema lovers.  
696395	10928556	41711	12605115	Taylor	Christy was a great hostess! She even helped us find a parking space near on a nearby street. The space itself was very cute, unique, clean, and looked just like the pictures. Only 2 blocks away from a subway stop, which was only a few stops from the Loop. I would definitely stay again!
696395	11028517	41715	7980002	Danielle	Christy was VERY hospitable! We came in at 1am and she went out of her way to help us find parking. We didn't get much social time as we were constantly running around places and I'm sad we didn't. Everyone we met was wonderful. The room is so adorable and the stairs that go up to the deck are pretty sweet. It's so close to downtown and easy to get around everywhere. I highly recommend Christy's place to anyone visiting Chicago!
696395	11114502	41719	12702889	Michelle	This was our first trip to Chicago, and Christy was a wonderful host and made us feel very welcome at her place. The room itself was great! It's very clean, spacious, and full of cool decorations. It is also very private. The stairs up to the deck are a great perk of staying here (and would be especially nice during the spring/summer).  Even the kitty was very friendly!  The location was ideal! A great coffee shop, called Lovely, is just a block away. Lots of good restaurants and interesting shops are within walking distance. One of the main subway stations to the blue line is super close, which made sightseeing easy and convenient. I would definitely recommend Christy's place to anyone traveling to Chicago! 
696395	11249945	41724	12483089	Nancy	This was our first experience using Airbnb for our trip to Chicago. Christy's place was very easy to find and was conveniently down the street from the blue line that connected us to the entire city. It was also walking distance to a ton of cool restaurants, cafÃ©s, and cool shops. The room we had was spacious, clean, and welcoming. It looks exactly as it does in the photos, too! The bathroom was right next to the room and very cool. I loved all the natural light that swarmed the apartment in the morning. Christy was very helpful and friendly. We really enjoyed our stay here and would recommend it to everyone! 
696395	11314439	41727	12195151	FrÃ©dÃ©ric	Pleasant and big room, close to the subway on the line between the airport and downtown. We didn't meet Christy but her welcoming boyfriend Jay for the check-in. Unfortunately our hosts wasn't here but they stay reachable and seems very friendly !
696395	11364235	41729	12881218	Ann	I didn't actually get to meet Christy, but her boyfriend Jay showed us the room. It was such a great room with lots of fun trinkets! The whole cinema was laid out in such a cool way. The rooftop deck overlooking the illuminated skyline was definitely a sweet way to finish out the night.Simon the cat is a great cohort as well. You HAVE to stay in this room. You won't regret it. 
696395	16438119	41847	18483372	Mark	Christy provided great communication and was very accommodating.  I would definitely recommend the room for someone looking for an economical stay in Chicago.  
696395	16688993	41851	16465177	Chris	Christy was out of Chicago for several Days so we stayed in her room for three nights and it was great! Spacious and clean room even with access to a rooftop! Area is close to the loop so just jump in the bus next to the place or walk 5 minutes to the blue line and go by train. I absolutely recommend to stay at Christys place!
696395	16799494	41853	2441670	Maloury	Christy is a great host. Easy to communicate with, she showed us around when we arrived and is super friendly! The house is in an awesome location, central to explore all that Chicago has to offer via divvy bikes, train or cab. We would definitely stay again and highly recommend! 
696395	24778305	42006	25014339	Anne	Great neighborhood. Easy to access transit.  Very nice home and well kept.  
696395	41860771	42225	39655134	Shelby	Christy's was an excellent host. The location is perfect and accessible from both airports. Christy was easy going & extremely helpful. Loved how flexible she was with our arrival and departure times. I would highly recommend staying here while visiting Chicago. 
696395	42946341	42232	9214910	Jillian Bean	My husband and I had a great time staying at Christy's place. Sunny is right! The room and deck are beautiful and a great place to relax at the end of a long day. The apartment was empty most of the time we were there (aside from the cat, who is very friendly), so we had a lot of privacy. The location is perfect for accessing any kind of transit, and the neighborhood is very nice.
696395	45148482	42247	40985299	Robyn	Christy was very friendly and willing to answer our questions. The only complaints I have are that the street you walk from the L to the apartment doesn't feel very safe. I also feel like the floor could have been cleaned better as well as the bathroom. Christy and her roommates were all super nice and made us feel comfortable. 
110705	277231	40686	390433	Pete	We had to cancel our trip at the last minute, and were looking forward to meeting John. He communicated with us very prompt and had clear directions. We hope to be able to stay with John on our future trips to Chicago. 
110705	302745	40701	338667	Jade	John was cooler than cool, completely laid back and welcoming.  We stayed for 5 days and the room was clean and airy and very comfortable, the bathroom was clean and we made good use of the private deck, it was hot!  The location is fantastic right near a station and John even let me use his bike to cycle down to the lake.  The whole stay was perfect, If I return to Chicago I would definitely stay there again. Thank you John and Bozena :)
110705	323065	40713	701944	Roseanna	The bed was very comfortable, had large, private deck that I enjoyed the next morning and the hosts were friendly and knowledgeable about the area.  Very satisfied!  Would stay there again!
110705	324180	40714	530591	David	Great house in Uptown. Close to Red Line. Breakfast was perfect!
110705	344999	40724	747766	Megan	john was a fantastic host! my boyfriend (sergio) and I had a wonderful stay here. the house is beautiful and the private deck made it that much better. john had his band over and we spent some time listening to them jam. he even let sergio pick up the guitar and play along with them. they are a fun loving group of guys who know how to get down with some great jazz music. we topped off our night by visiting the green mill for some more jazz music - it was all around a wonderful night in a wonderful house! thanks again john!
110705	354990	40729	388744	Roger	Wonderful place to stay - the room is clean, comfortable and nicely decorated!  The deck is great and I used it every day.  What makes this place special are the hosts John and Bozena.  They are cool people, friendly & nice, and and have great suggestions for places to eat and visit. Good restaurants are within walking distance.  Highly recommend!
110705	376914	40740	785360	Colin	Beautiful House with wonderful, generous hosts!  I came with a friend who was auditioning for the Chicago Symphony â€“ we are both classical musicians â€“ and it was incredible to be able to work and practice in John's studio in the basement.  He left us the space whenever and however much we needed. He was gracious, and being a musician himself, very understanding... Always willing to help, answer questions, and make our stay as comfortable as possible. Honestly, the stay in their house was one of the highlights of our time in Chicago.  
110705	381939	40742	815170	Melissa	My fiance and I had very comfortable and relaxed stay at John's place.  He was super accommodating when we arrived and even took us around the block to show us attractions and restaurants.  The red line is also conveniently located right around the corner.  The room was lovely with a plush bed and super huge private deck right off of it.  You will be entertained by the squirrels, no doubt!  The bathroom was right next door and very large.  Breakfast was conitental style and tasty.  All in all, we appreciated the hands-off, common sense vibe, which felt like we were staying with a friend rather than a hotel.  We definitely recommend this room.
110705	389572	40746	819672	Richard	John and Bozena are the most accommodating and gracious hosts and their home is beautiful and inviting. My room and bed there were very comfortable, clean and, most importantly during a sweltering Chicago heat wave, deliciously air conditioned which equals a great night's sleep! Because of my work schedule, I did not have the opportunity to spend much time socializing with them or their other house guests, but maybe next time?! I would definitely stay with them again.
110705	416518	40757	887019	John	Our stay was great. John was a nice host. He is very friendly and definitely chill, very accommodating of our late rising time each day. John made every effort to help point us in the right direction as far as what kinds of things we were hoping to see in Chicago. The house has an abundance of character: lots of wood, art, and interesting books. Although the room doesn't have its own bathroom and several people were sharing the house, we did not run into traffic jams at the bathroom. Convenient, too: only a block from the Lawrence station on the red line.
110705	425820	40762	759745	Jesse	"John wasn't kidding when he offered ""a beautiful room with a private deck.""  The room was lovely, with a big, comfortable bed and fantastic interior design.  The private deck was huge and we spent a lot of time out there enjoying the ambiance of the north end of the city.  As for John himself, we could not have asked for a more gracious host.  He was extremely accomidating and only seemed to appear when we needed something.  He knows the city and the area, and Apryl and I look forward to staying there again on our next trip to Chicago.  Outstanding price for amazing accomidations.  Thanks again, John.Apryl and Jesse"
110705	432362	40764	302697	Sheryl	I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at John's home, great house with a great room. Loved the deck!
110705	461021	40775	703335	Joel	John was a great host and has a easy going vibe.  The room was comfortable and the deck is really fantastic.  The neighborhood is a little far north and on the quiet side but felt safe.  The house is very close to the subway for easy downtown access.
110705	548541	40805	844915	Erin	The house was beautiful and the location was perfect! So close to the subway and to both an amazing Ethiopian and Chinese restaurant. Parking was easy the weekend we stayed and it wasn't too cold so we were able to get to many of the places we wanted to go by walking. John was very attentive and gave us a great restaurant recommendation. We would absolutely recommend staying here. 
110705	565142	40811	897867	Amy	John and Bozena were lovely hosts.  They had lots of suggestions of where to eat, get groceries and visit in the neighbourhood.    And the breakfast they provided was great for me on the go!The room was clean, and the bed was very comfortable.  I didn't use the private deck because it rained a lot the week I was there, but it would be a great place to read on a warm day.The location was very convenient for me, as I was working in the area.  The only thing I'd say about the location, is the check it out before you book to make sure it works for you!Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely stay with John and Bozena again!
110705	594380	40819	1177641	Mark	We enjoyed our stay with John - it offered great value for staying within a half mile of our son's home, compared to limited Hotel and B&B alternatives on this busy weekend in Chicago.  John volunteered to drop the key at our son's house when he couldn't be present for our late arrival, he called to make sure we had arrived safely, and helped us get settled even though it was around midnight. There was no issue with access to the shared bathroom, which was well equipped.  The self-serve breakfast was very good.  This was our first Airbnb experience, and we will definitely use Airbnb again for other travel.
110705	647543	40836	1176817	Sophie	I had a wonderful stay with John and Bosheena in Chicago.I stayed with them for over two weeks and every evening it felt like returning home.They give a lot of information about the areas to visit and things to do and are concerned about the guests having a nice stay (without imposing themselves).The room is really very comfortable and clean; the deck is a great private place to relax in the sun.
110705	664999	40841	1273418	MÃ©lani	John and his wife are super welcoming, very charming and relaxed!  They both helped us to get around and give us info.  Their house is warm and inviting, and very confortable.  The location for me was great, easily accessible by the L train, out of the hectic of downtown.  I highly recommand these hosts to anyone and would surely stay with them again on a next trip.
110705	827014	40910	1451025	Tracy	John was great! The place was spotless and the two girls loved having their own room! The pictures do not lie! It was a great experience. It was our first time staying in something like this and John made it a great experience; I just hope we all handled ourselves appropriately! 
110705	1003733	40983	1666877	Ariel	John and Bozena were fantastic hosts. Their house was a fantastic place to be able to explore the city from, or even stay in and relax. The weather happened to be gorgeous while I was there, so the porch was great to take advantage of. The breakfast they provided was generous, as was their hospitality. Their dog Bailey is a doll as well. Would definitely stay there again.
110705	1073816	41001	1912647	Lauren & Gideon	My traveling companion and I were pleased to find John was both helpful and unobtrusive. He recommended a great sushi place within walking distance, and after seeing a show at the nearby jazz club we comfortably swapped notes on the performance (excellent), service (surly) and ambiance (historical). Our room was clean and cozy; the other house guests were friendly while following their own agendas. The only thing missing was the sauna, which was out of working service while we were there. All the more reason to come back!
110705	1139486	41015	1979038	Shandelle	We found the host very welcoming, helpful, and hospitable. The house was very spacious and interesting in decor. The bed mattress extremely comfortable and we awoke very well rested. The bathroom was also very uniquely decorated and convenient to our room. Parking was close by and easy to obtain for our car. We loved the pleasant surprise of the attached outdoor deck from our bedroom. We would definitely book another stay with John!
110705	1167643	41022	1838167	Susanne	It was just perfect ! John was a great host. Will come back.
110705	1223628	41032	2195683	Jacalyn	Our experience with John and Bozena may have spoiled me and my husband. The house is beautiful, just as the photographs reveal.The location ideal, we hopped on the train, and the city was ours. John and Bozena were helpful, friendly and gracious hosts! What more could we ask for?
110705	1256671	41039	1776347	Sally	We thoroughly enjoyed our short stay at this lovely house in Chicago and John was incredibly accommodating. We would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to experience a bit more of a Chicago lifestyle rather than just seeing the inside of a hotel. The 20-25 minute ride into town went quickly and having the subway station so nearby to the house meant that it was quick and easy to commute in. We actually went out a couple of times in the local area as well (had the yummiest Ethiopian meal followed by a stint at Al Capone's favourite jazz bar) which just goes to show that it's not all in downtown. John was really great in accommodating my friends and I, being very flexible and helpful in happily putting up 5 of us on the first night, 6 on the second night and 7 in the final two nights. Thank you so much for such a brilliant experience and lovely accommodation.
110705	1291080	41045	2220644	Mason	The hosts were very friendly and accessible when need be. My partner and I needed to do a bit of cooking for a birthday party one day while we were staying there and they were extremely helpful showing us around the tools they had in the kitchen. The steam bath was great and the private deck was bigger than I imagined, 
110705	1343835	41053	1858611	Kate	John was an excellent host. The room was clean and exceptionally comfortable. He had wonderful recommendations for food and activities that he tailored to our interests. I would stay with John in Chicago again, anytime. 
110705	1396852	41061	338667	Jade	We stayed here last year, and this year we decided to stay again as it was just SO good. I would normally be inclined to seek a different experience but we enjoyed it and felt so comfortable here. We made use of the deck again and one hot evening got to hear the lovely jazzy samba music drifting up from Johns band rehearsal downstairs.  I cant rate John and Bozena enough, their house is spacious, clean, comfortable and convenient, a real pleasure and better than any hotel...I'm sure I'll be back again! Thank you both for being fantastic hosts :)
110705	1420701	41065	31306	Wendy	John & Bozena are delightful giving people that extend themselves beyond to make sure you are equipped with all your needs during your stay with them. We came to Chicago for a wedding primarily,  & to squeeze in as much of Chicago we could possible do in those extra days. Both John & Bozena were there to help us with maps, directions, knowledge of places to go see & do,  they provided us with a GPS navigator & car phone charger-to help us alongâ€¦â€¦We had a blast in this great city! Their location is greatâ€¦.right there across the carpart is L line that will take you into the heart of the city within a 1/2 hr fun rideâ€¦fyi a car is a costly hinderance if going downtown- super easy with public transportationâ€¦.unlike LA. We arrived at their abode by train/bus to their place, super easy & dead on accurate with John's nifty precise directions- which  you are graced with once you book and it only cost us $2.50 each from the airport!  It was lovely having this room with the balcony- we could get to gather ourselves privately in the mornings & enjoy the late evenings on the deck. Note it is a shared bath that is a great trade-off for balcony & pricing. This area/Uptown- has great history- the home of the 1st silent movies and all the great actors/musicians & bad boys christened these streetsâ€¦. The famous Green Mill Jazz Bar is just around the corner if you want to get a bit of Al Capone history & enjoy a variety of excellent live jazz- What a great find this isâ€¦â€¦  Charlie Chaplin, Gloria Swanson and other early film stars produced films at the Essanay Studios on Argyle Stâ€¦.. The Aragon Ballroom, Riviera Theater, Uptown Theatre, are all located within a half block.  We walked to  famous Wrigly-Field, Andersonville & Tweets for a a huge selection of eats/ 5menus to choose fromâ€¦..We walked to Graceland Cemetery/ one of Chicago's most celebrated final resting spots for artisansâ€¦.So much to see & do right hereâ€¦..Great spot/Great home/Great peopleâ€¦â€¦Enjoyâ€¦..
110705	1453759	41071	634190	Carmen	Beautiful home, awesome location, tremendously kind hosts and one of the sweetest dogs ever... Can't ask for anything more! Very grateful and satisfied with choice. 
110705	1517380	41079	2450262	Tara	This space is exactly like advertised. The location was so wonderful. I would highly recommend staying here.
110705	1566086	41086	567571	Marla	This was our second stay with John and Bozena and our first in the room with the deck. The room was attractive, clean and quiet. We loved the remodeled shower/spa. John and Bozena are great hosts and Bailey, the dog, is a fun and sweet addition to the household. We are so glad we found this Chicago treasure. We will definitely be back!
110705	1710410	41105	2416047	Keith	John and Bozena were delightful and attentive, but not overly attentive, hosts.   Everything was clean, the room was bright and cheerful, the bathroom was luxurious, the amenities, including breakfast, were first rate, the neighborhood was safe and the street parking was abundant.  We'd definitely come again.
110705	1801139	41115	2959270	Jean-Christophe	Great place
110705	1838694	41120	2768339	Gioele	We spent 5 nights at John's and Bozena's house and we had a great time! Everything is very clean and exactly how it looks like in the pictures!They were very helpful and the train station is a 30 seconds-walk away. We could also use their bikes to have a little downtown-bike-tour.
110705	1875648	41124	2376120	Dmitry	â€œHome is not where you live, but where they understand youâ€, said a poet. John and Bozena's house becomes your home the minute you meet them. I wish I had stayed longer.
110705	1952469	41132	3093290	Massimiliano	John and Bozena have been very friendly and supportive hosts: they lent us their bicycles so we could experience the fantastic lake view trail (and we really enjoyed it although the rain!!), they offered us breakfast, they let us use their wi-fi and provided good suggestions (including maps printed on purpose!) to visit Chicago and the neighborhood. The house, bedroom and bathroom were exactly as shown in pictures... very beautiful, clean and comfy. 
110705	2015100	41138	2094057	Dina	This was such a great place to stay. I'm going back for sure. John was very helpful and kind, and he even called to make sure I wasn't lost an hour before my arrival time.The house is gorgeous. And so close to everything! Plus there's coffee all the time, and a steam room in the shower.  I highly recommend.
110705	2088962	41146	2162022	Lyn & Roger	What a brilliant stay at John & Bozena's. They made us very welcome, gave us great advice for things going on, printed out theatre & baseball tickets, flight check-ins, etc. Best of all, they offered us the use of their bikes, & this made our stay extra special.Their home is so well situated and in a very pleasant neighbourhood - just 1/2 hour (on the Red line) from the centre, & only minutes away from the station, so travelling in & out was easy & fun. Despite being just one block away from the station, we were not at all disturbed by any train noise, even when out on the balcony. Our room was great, & the outside balcony was well worth the extra few dollars per night, plus the bathroom that comes with the room - steam & body-jet shower was excellent.Good breakfast, plus the facility to make coffee was most welcome.We would certainly book again if we ever return to Chicago, and can wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who is looking for somewhere really good to stay.
110705	2118017	41148	3316516	Brittany	John was a very good host. The house was amazing and very clean. I had a lot of fun and plan to go back in a few months. I would highly recommend their house! 
110705	2183582	41155	1884348	Dorian & Tina	Very accommodating, friendly, and welcoming. Exactly what we wanted. 6 stars for John and Bozena.
110705	2204257	41156	3355909	Anna & Boris	John was very nice and accommodating throughout our short stay. We really enjoyed the deck that attached to the bedroom (at his recommendation we had a glass of wine out there at night and then breakfast the following morning). They really did a great job of being professional and providing us with everything that we needed.  
110705	2385126	41175	3450916	Cristina	John and Bozena are great hosts, they are extremely friendly, helpful and always available. Me and my family enjoyed staying with them very much. 
110705	2426747	41179	1851785	Glenn Francis	Well what can we say if you are looking for a great place to stay in Chicago with the best hosts you could imagine look no further. John and Bozena made us feel like family . They provided us with all the information we required to make our stay a memorable one. Their place is close to the trains which made it easy to get around. We would definitely stay with John and Bozena again if we ever returned 
110705	2549848	41190	3712173	K	"We stayed with John and Bozena for four days as a retreat from the mess and chaos of the remodeling of our condo in Chicago.  The spa was wonderful daily therapy.  Their location is a food-lovers' paradise.  In four days we enjoyed Indian, Vietnamese, Ethiopian and Persian restaurants, all within a few easy block walk. The Red Line ""El/Subway"" stop is around the corner for easy access to downtown and all the cultural activities of Chicago.  The beach and an 18 mile lakefront bike/jogging trail are just a few blocks away.  John and Bozena offered good suggestions for restaurants and entertainment.  Their coffee in the morning was really good!!Ken and Jan Anderson"
110705	2594821	41195	2936465	Lucy	They have a very nice home and are conveniently a block from a train stop. They opened their house to us, even inviting us to watch TV in their living room. They even lent us bicycles so that we could go to the movies! John and Bozena made us feel at home their home. We highly recommend staying with them.
110705	2671725	41203	3573905	Hermine	my daughter, my mom and me had a very good time with John and Bozena. The room was exactly like the pictures and description and the ajoining deck is awsome. Unfortunately the weather was not so good so we didnt sit outside in the evening. John and Bozena are wonderful hosts: they were always helpful with information and very generous with the use of their kitchen and appliances.  We got to know them as open and tolerant people, who were always  interested, ready to talk or help out  but also leave you to yourself.  . And bailey.... is absolutely adorable! He's always ready to play and well behaved. if you tell him, he can't come into the room, he'll just sit outside and after a bit he'll wander off without complaint.Thanks John, thanks Bozena, when we come back to Chicago, we'll be sure to book the room again.best regards Hermine Altink
110705	2693380	41204	3905723	Willie	John and Bozena were very helpful in getting us settled in and pointing out a couple places we could go for good food. The room and bathroom were both very nicely decorated and clean. I didn't get a chance to use the private deck since I only stayed one night. One thing is that I didn't realize that we'd be sharing a bathroom with another guest (not sure if that's my fault for not reading the whole description of the place). Not a big issue, but there was a time I wanted to use it and I couldn't.Overall, this was a great place to stay if you want some privacy, and it's conveniently located near metro stations/bus stops/good food (all within 15 min walks). There was a bit of construction going on nearby outside and our wall was adjacent to another guest's, but it wasn't too loud at any point.
110705	2819109	41218	3963767	Wei	Nice house and nice John. This is also my first airbnb experience, and John had made it perfect. He helped me find out the way, he even walked with me to the CTA station. It is near and very convenient. Thanks, John.
110705	2944170	41235	2065707	A.	Was an excellent 3 night stay with easy parking and gracious and warm hosts. Great area, comfy clean room and I was lucky to use the steam shower as well as the deck for some sunshine and fresh hair. You cannot go wrong with this listing in the uptown neighborhood of Chicago. John and Bozena went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable and are so easy to communicate with.  
110705	4849813	41422	4969	Amy	Our stay was quite enjoyable. The room was exactly as described, with an extremely comfortable bed and bedding. The deck was nice for sitting with a cup of coffee and reading, or just basking in what little sun was around the weekend we stayed. John and Bozena were gracious and welcoming, and their dog (Bailey) was friendly; my son and I both enjoyed playing catch with him for quite some time! We would definitely recommend staying here â€“ and you HAVE to try out the amazing spa shower. I wish I could have taken it home with me! 
110705	4998831	41431	6452792	Randy	John & Bozena were great hosts. Very cozy room with a large deck attached to our room that we used every day. Lots of stuff (restaurants etc) within walking distance made the location ideal. Bailey the dog was a lot of fun for dog people such as ourselves. Our shower was the most high tech that I've ever seen and worked well.Our hosts went out of their way to take care of us.The next time we go to Chicago we'll plan to stay with them again.Overall a great experience and value. Thanks
110705	5030386	41433	6718517	Anthony	Excellent. Warm. Perfect B&B for a short or long term stay on the north side of Chicago. John and Bozena are dedicated hosts. I highly recommend their home for travelers of all experiences. 
110705	5049714	41435	5371385	Carol	very sweet hosts, nice house with a very comfortable bed in the big room with deck.  bailey the dog was quiet, cute and goofy.  there are a lot of nice books on the living room table, Chicago-oriented, which i didn't notice until our last day.  the bathroom has a great shower (i think there's endless hot water), and the location was two blocks from the El.   there are at least four guest rooms, but there are separate bathrooms for each floor.  
110705	5131792	41439	826256	Travis	John and Bozena were excellent hosts.  Our stay with them was perfect.  They were both easy going and helpful.  John offered a lot of great information about the neighborhood and city - places to visit, restaurants to eat in, ways to get around.  Since we were interested in moving into Chicago, John even gave us a little tour of surrounding neighborhoods that might be of interests to us.The room and house were luxurious and located in a great spot.  Bedroom was clean, bright and had an amazing deck.  Bathroom and shower were just as pictured.  Neighborhood had nice options for places to eat and things to do (jazz, improv theater, awesome park and beach).   It was also conveniently located one block from Redline L train making downtown and the entire city quite accessible.  Bailey, their dog, was sweet and friendly.  We brought along our small dog, Mindy.  John and Bozena were very good with Mindy and so was Bailey.We would highly recommend staying with them if you are in Chicago. 
110705	5425726	41454	7107382	Daniela	John and Bozena were excellent hosts and very accommodating. The house was beautiful and very inviting. Thanks for a wonderful stay. 
110705	5639827	41464	2813224	Irina	What a lovely house with lovely hosts! My boyfriend and I stayed in the bedroom with the beautiful private deck. John And Bozena were very accommodating, and made sure we were very comfortable. The coffee was delicious, and there was also always breakfast available. The house is very clean, very inviting and felt like home.It is located in an uptown neighborhood, but don't let that fool you- the train station is only a block away, and it takes about 20min to get downtown. There are also plenty of buses around to help you get around. The beach is a 10min walk away, and there's a fun dog beach nearby as well. I highly recommend this place!
110705	5951401	41478	1633750	Frank	John, Bozena, and Bailey the dog, have an amazing home and I couldn't say enough good things about our stay here. Conveniently located by the metro, the Green Mill (very authentic speakeasy jazz bar), restaurants, bars and other nightlife. Our hosts John and Bozena were extremely helpful and super accommodating, and helped make our stay in Chicago a memorable one. I'd plan to stay again if visiting Chicago again.  
110705	6084011	41484	1124365	Peggy	John and Bozrena made us feel welcome and our room with a private deck was perfect. 
110705	6315268	41493	7880267	Jeremy	Had a great stay with John and Bozena, who were very friendly and very accommodating to us, all of our luggage, and our labrador! Highly recommended.
110705	6458389	41499	6659460	Jane	"Easy access to transportation - Location right next to a ""red line"" stop.  Bathroom very nice, and our bedroom had sliding door access right onto a roof-top sun deck.  Nice accommodations and friendly hosts.   Easy going, chill.  Recommended place, good value. "
110705	7097558	41523	3065028	Michel	IdÃ©alement situÃ©e, Ã  cÃ´tÃ© de la ligne rouge (Red Line), la maison est trÃ¨s frÃ©quentÃ©e. John est un hÃ´te cordial et sympathique. Lui et Bozena sont trÃ¨s d'arrangement pour organiser vos choses.Vous pourrez y faire des rencontres intÃ©ressantes.Achetez-vous une passe CTA si vous sÃ©journez pour quelques jours.
110705	7172357	41526	8205985	Joe	"We arrived a few hrs late due to delays, I contacted John to let him know.  He was at the home when we arrived and was very pleasant. John took the time to explain in details all the home amenities, more or less: Mi Casa es Su Casa. The room was neat and clean, roomy and private.The deck off the bedroom was Awesome for am coffee and relaxing after treading all day in Chicago.Very Pleasant stay, Great house host!Recommend Fat Cats bar near by for drinks and dinner, Awesome staff!The house is less than one block from ""L"" track connect!"
110705	7293139	41531	8695335	Carol	It was a beautiful historic (1906, I believe) home that has been updated. The large spa bathroom (with filtered water) was great. Complementary coffee in the morning was nice. We had a private deck which we enjoyed briefly. Located close to L station. Area itself  (Uptown) has several cool ethnic restaurants, and a must is going to the historic Green Mill Jazz Club. Did not see hosts much, so we had some privacy, but they were very nice and were sure to ask if everything was fine. (Note, bathroom on each floor is shared, but we never had an issue).
110705	7381782	41534	6824882	Rogelio	John and Bozena where amazing hosts, John gave us accurate directions on how to get to the house, the house is really nice, clean and confortable, the traina station is just steps away perfect to get to know all of chicago, can wait to come back!!!!Thanks you very much John hope to see you soon.
110705	7720724	41547	8944151	Danielle	We had a fantastic stay at John and Bozena's. Great location getting in to Chicago centre and the surrounding areas. The itinerary they put together was really helpful with great recommendations. Tweet in particular was brilliant for breakfast.It was really quiet at night and the room was clean and more than comfortable. We would definitely stay again!
110705	7892163	41554	7940742	Margaux	This was my first time using airbnb. The accommodations were absolutely lovely. John and Bozena are wonderful hosts! An added bonus is that their house is very close to public transportation. Overall a wonderful experience. Highly recommended! 
110705	7969010	41557	380701	Cliff	John and Bozena's place is old, charming and well maintained in a great area of Chicago not normally visited by tourists for there are no big hotels nearby. Bozena recommended several great Jazz venues nearby which were world class in quality and made our visit memorable indeed,
110705	8099786	41562	1629734	Alessio	The apartment is literally 2 minutes walk from red metro (which is also the main one to head downtown) and the neighborhood is really nice, 25 minutes tube ride from the loop (main central area). My room was super nice with  a huge bed, well equipped and with a private deck. The Jacuzzi bath with steam shower was also a fun and relaxing experience. John and Bozen were great: warm and very helpful they made me feel home. I loved Chicago and loved to stay in their place. Thanks guys, hope to see you soon.
110705	10551953	41694	10360724	Sam	Very easy to communicate with via email and phone. Really enjoyed our stay and the space was exactly as advertised. The spa/shower was great and spent some time on the deck, even though it was cold outside. We took John's brunch recommendation for Nookies and it was fantastic.
110705	11768088	41743	13741751	Amanda	John and Bozena were very friendly and accommodating. The accommodations were just as described; wonderful!  The stay was also convenient to everything in uptown Chicago including 2 concert venues (Riveria & Aragon).  I would reccommend this place to anyone. 
110705	12183873	41754	6834888	Noah	John and Bozena are great. They were easy to contact, welcoming, had great advice for places to go and things to do. Their directions to the house are easy to follow and made everything super simple. The room was great--my only regret is I wasn't in town long enough to take advantage of the porch! A special shout out goes to the bathroom, which features a shower that seems capable of controlling the nation's nuclear arsenal. Definitely definitely stay here! 
110705	12314208	41757	7785144	Sally	Terrific stay and accommodations! John and Bozema were great hosts. The room was just as pictured. Having the deck just outside the room made for a lovely evening. Other guests were also in the house, but we didn't see them. Take John and Bozema up on their dinner recommendations (the Ethiopian restaurant half-block away was excellent). Easy access to the trains and a nice walk to Andersonville. We'll be back - thanks!
110705	12480193	41762	12620963	Aaron	John and Bozena were both great. They were very accommodating and knew the area well. The house was spacious and beautiful. I highly recommend staying at their home.
110705	13230240	41781	15569613	Erica	Our stay with John as Bozena was very comfortable. The room was exactly as pictured and the house was clean and well-organized. They were very accommodating to our travel schedule. We would definitely recommend staying with them! 
110705	13315876	41784	14605667	Carliene	"The Garvey household was a delight! The room was as advertised, and the spa a wonderful perk! Can't imagine a better time than early spring to visit Chicago, and we enjoyed sunny days with light breeze on the patio adjacent to the bedroom. Comfortable bed and linens, and the bathroom was spacious - plenty of room for my husband and I to get ready for the day. Literally a couple of blocks from the RED LINE ""L"" in vibrant Uptown. No need to rent a car - we enjoyed walk to the lake (less than 1 mile) and noticed the public bike racks next to the L station. Between the L and buses, we were as mobile as we wanted to be. Thursday night SWING at the Green Mill was unforgettable. We are grateful to John for his warm welcome upon our arrival, and for walking with us the few blocks from the house to point out favorite restaurants. Would definitely seek to stay here should we be fortunate enough to visit Chicago again. "
110705	14198443	41804	15363151	Bonnie	This was our first Airbnb experience. It couldn't be bettered. We even got to hear John's band perform & they let us sit in. We were on a musical tour & this was the ideal start.
110705	15888840	41837	10954403	Richard	My partner and I spent 3 days here earlier this week, and found it to be exactly as described.  The bedroom was great, the bathroom and shower were even better, and the deck was a nice extra.  We didn't spend much time in the house, but felt perfectly welcome.  The location, just a block away from the El, was great - very accessible to the North Side and the Loop, and a pleasant short walk to the Lake.  But it's far enough from the El to not make it noisy.  We would definitely stay here again.
110705	17882911	41869	8560924	Jonas	Being a guest at John & Bozena's was great. We found everything as described, the sundeck was a real highlight and John a very friendly host. We'd comeback any time! 
110705	18921823	41884	19978043	Jorge	Best Airbnbs I've stayed.
110705	19607267	41897	18997021	Javier	We had a great experience in Chicago. John provided everything we needed, umbrellas, towels... He gave very nice advice on what places to visit. The rooms and bed were clean and the bathroom awesome.
110705	21997496	41939	6179558	Arris	I had a great time. Very nice house and very relaxing.
110705	22675304	41954	495956	Kathy	made us feel very welcome. 
110705	23493480	41975	14231793	Donald	John and Bozena clearly know what it takes to make people comfortable.  He met us at the door, showed us to our room and explained what we needed to know.  In our room was an extensive pamphlet on house details as well as restaurant and entertainment suggestions.  The bed was very comfortable and the well-equipped bathroom with double sinks (one with filtered water) and plenty of towels was a pleasant surprise.  Both rooms were tastefully decorated.  Although we could  not utilize the spacious deck because of the cool weather, we hope to return some day in a warmer season.  Thanks so much for a very enjoyable stay!
110705	29860452	42107	1775328	Cindy	Thank you John for welcoming Dan and I to your beautiful home. We really enjoyed the deck off of our room. We sat outside and soaked up the sights and sounds of Chicago. We were in town for a concert at theRiviera...great place....close to venue. Convenient to the Red line and good restaurants.
110705	30262867	42113	11077257	Lawrence	John and Bozena were excellent! They supplied us with everything we need and their house manual was most helpful. You could not be closer to the Aragon if you're looking to stay for a show, like we did, and the same goes for the L. John provided me with the parking tickets to park on the street overnight which I was most grateful for. The deck was perfect. They were nice enough to let us rent a room even though they had a party coming early morning at the end of our stay. Looking forward to coming back again sometime! 
110705	30841543	42121	31702118	Jen	Lovely easy place to stay, friendly hosts who had good ideas of where to go in the local area (the Green Mill is just around the corner, and the sushi at John's suggested restaurant was delicious), and a cute dog! 
110705	31103528	42126	28646319	Cameron	John and Bozena were absolutely fantastic hosts - friendly, welcoming and helpful. 
110705	34956463	42169	31242658	Clark	"This was our first AirBNB experience and it was very good.  John & Bozena made us feel like we were at home.  They were very helpful and gave us good advice on everything we asked from them.  Our room was exactly as described on website.  They have a very nice and quiet home.  It is very easy and close to ""L"" train to get around Chicago.  John guided us on how to use the CTA to get around town since we have never used anything besides a car.  We would stay there again."
110705	35576252	42175	33953012	Julia	John und Bozena haben sich vorab mit detaillierten Infos bei mir gemeldet, was mir sehr geholfen hat. Es wurde beschrieben wie genau die SchlÃ¼sselÃ¼bergabe von Statten geht und welche Bahn bzw. Bus ich nehmen soll. Auch habe ich eine Liste mit SehenswÃ¼rdigkeiten, Restaurants usw. bekommen. Die Beschreibung des Zimmers war akkurat, fast besser in Wirklichkeit. Das Einchecken verlief nett, reibungslos und unkompliziert.
110705	36128230	42180	15261838	Kyung	The stay was very enjoyable. The location of the house was very convenient. No issues with facility.
110705	36347669	42182	34003460	Sawyer	John was there to greet us as we arrived and showed us around the wonderful home. After that, we did not have much interaction with them, but everything we needed was provided. The location of the home was fantastic. A very eclectic neighborhood with quick access to the 'L' trains to downtown or a quick walk to Lake Michigan. Plenty of yummy restaurants in the area too. Overall, would stay again any time I am in the area. 
110705	36819547	42186	36057668	Jeff	Everything was perfect! We just needed a nice place to sleep in the heart of the city. Everything was clean, quite, and unobtrusive. Would definitely recommend!
110705	46202317	42255	506383	Michiko	This place was great. The house is clean and well-maintained. In addition, the location was perfect for me and my boyfriend. We did a lot of sightseeing during the day, and came back the neighborhood to have a drink at the nearby bar. The host was very kind and very informative about things to do in Chicago. I definitely recommend this place. 
3553920	15848679	41836	3364589	Lindsay	Bogdan's apartment was amazing and was perfect for our group of four. With the third bedroom, though, the space could easily accommodate a couple more.  The pictures here do not do the apartment justice! It was completely renovated from top to bottom, so we felt as though we were in a luxury hotel. The outside brownstone was on the cutest street in the heart of Lincoln Park surrounded by restaurants, cafÃ©s, and shops. (Our favorite was the tapas restaurant right next door. Highly recommended!) We loved the vibe of the area, which felt much more lively, real, and less touristy than the loop. We took a leisurely walk back from Michigan Avenue one evening, but otherwise the red and brown lines got us to the loop in 15 minutes or less. Groceries were available within walking distance, and the kitchen is furnished with everything you need to cook. We even opened a lot of the packages because everything was brand new. Bogdan made sure all of our needs were met and checked in with us several times. We had a wonderful six nights here and truly cannot say enough about how great the apartment and our experience was. Thanks, Bogdan! 
3553920	16161256	41842	7354122	Leo	Everything was clean and well organized. Even had a parking spot in the back. Great place. Neighborhood is nice and convenient.
3553920	16795076	41853	16255964	Joseph	Place was truly great. It is on third floor in case anyone has trouble with stairs. Roomy spacious. 2 of the beds are super comfortable. Would stay again.
3553920	17066356	41857	1210746	Andreea	Great location, nice apartment with nice kitchen and bathroom. Everything was provided clean sheets, towels, kitchen stuff. Free Wi-Fi and parking a bonus. We had a pleasant stay.
3553920	17315838	41861	19283117	Monica	The general experience with Home Away From Home was very good. The apartment was nice and the amenities were as described. In addition, Bogdan was nice and courteous with as. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that there were two unexpected stairs flights to reach the apartment which in our case (we had an stroller) made it a bit inconvenient. If that is not your case, I would definitely go for Home Away From Home.For non Chicagoers, at first glance the location might not look very good. Nothing further from the truth. The apartment is 2 minutes walking to the brown line and 12 minutes walking to the red line. In addition, the neighborhood is full of life (bars, restaurants, some shops) which makes the location perfect if look for a combination of tourism, entertainment and tranquility (during weekdays).Besides the mentioned accessibility issue the apartment was great. At arrival time everything was clean. Actually it looked like recently painted. Central AC, super-comfortable beds, equipped kitchen with basic hardware, clean and pretty new bathroom made our stay quite good. Although Bogdan did not show up, he promptly answered our phone call when needed and periodically checked with text messages if everything was OK at the apartment.
3553920	17860381	41869	18600171	Lynn	The listing was very accurate and the accommodations were very good. The beds were comfortable and the kitchen was relatively well equipped. The apt was clean and well kept. The location of the apt is fantastic - right in the heart of Lincoln Park which was great for us.
3553920	18328067	41876	12301121	Jared	I am a little torn on what to write, in all honesty. I will start with the positives. 1: The location is fantastic, very safe and also convenient to everywhere we wanted to get. 2: The price, especially for a 3 bedroom place, was also great. The negatives. 1: Being in a busy part of town, as well as right next to several bars, the late night noise was pretty bad. It may have just been that particular night (Friday), because Saturday did not seem quite so bad. All four of us that were staying there were woken up at 2:30 am. 2: This was the bigger annoyance for me. We got there on Wednesday and the cable was not working. No big deal. Bogdan asked us to let him know later if it did not come back on. We did. He was very apologetic, and did immediately call Comcast to schedule them to come out. He had them set up for Friday between 3-5. I assumed either he, or someone he arranged for, would be there to wait for Comcast. We were in Chicago to go to see the Orioles play, and at 2:55 pm Friday I got a text from Bogdan verifying that we would be there to let Comcast in. I do not  wait for my own cable guy, much less someone else's, and I told him that I would have expected him to make arrangements. He proceeded to get an attitude with me, and said that if he knew we were in Chicago to watch tv he would have made sure he had a backup cable box. We were not in the place much at all during the day, but it would have been nice to have cable for between games and dinner, or winding down at the end of the night. Obviously we did not visit to watch tv, but if you advertise that you have cable and do not, do not give me attitude and say you are not running a hotel. Without posting all the messages back and forth, I will just say that I found the attitude he approached the issue with to be poor at best. Thankfully it was just the tv, and not a major issue. None of us would have had any issue if he would have offered even a token reduction in price, and left it as an apology. I would say that if you do not care about poor customer service, this is a perfect location to rent, and very fairly priced overall. 
3553920	18805183	41883	18182393	Mary	This was a great place to stay. This was my 3rd trip to Chicago and first time using AirBnB. Would definitely recommend Bogdan's place to friends. Great kitchen. Awesome bathroom. Comfortable beds! Generous linens and kitchen supplies. Parking spaces are great asset!
3553920	19134623	41889	2600243	Ann	I didn't ever meet my host. I called to get information to enter the apartment, and the next day with a question. Bogdan did ask me during the second phone call if everything was alright. And it was. Very nice apartment and a perfect location for my needs.
3553920	19520769	41896	15844724	Meghan	GREAT experience. The apt was SO clean and beautiful. Perfect for what we needed. Newly renovated and can't stress enough how clean the place was. Bogdan greeted us with the keys and even carried my luggage up the steps for me. He checked in during our stay to make sure we were happy with the place. I highly recommend staying here.  The apt is surrounded by great shops and places to eat. I would not recommend this place for people with small children only because there is a bar next door and it can get a little loud at night time. We slept right through it but can imagine it would wake up a child. We will be renting this place when we return to Chicago in the future. 
3553920	19779342	41900	17923530	Marilyn	Bogdan responded to my texts very quickly, and left the keys in a lockbox so no stress upon arrival!  The apartment was beautiful and clean, and the kitchen and bath were equipped with all needed items, which was also great!  Loved the frig with ice, quality cookware/dishes, and the luxurious bath & shower :)  Only item missing was a coffee pot, which we found at a nearby thrift store the next day.  The neighborhood had lots of interesting shops, and we visited both the tapas and street tacos restaurants (both great!).   We walked to Lincoln Park and had a great time exploring there.. zoo, conservatory, museum.  The beds were comfortable & it was quiet at nite, with a great street view from the living room window.  The two flights of stairs were challenging for us 'seniors' at the end of the day, but we looked at it as an exercise opportunity!  Would definitely recommend Bogdan's apartment and this neighborhood as great places to stay and explore :) 
3553920	19944896	41903	18604262	Eileen	The apartment was perfect for our girls weekend getaway. The description was true, and there was even an air mattress that was available to use as the third bed is twin size. Bogdan made sure to check in with us to see if we needed anything. The location was nice and there were several good restaurants within walking distance. We would definitely stay here again.
3553920	20213389	41907	6083557	Casey	My boyfriend and I had a great time in Chicago. This unit's location in Lincoln park is great for access to bus and train options. Also, the walk to Lincoln park is not far and all the tree lined streets along the way makes it really nice. There are quite a few stores and shops nearby, both big name and boutique. Food and drinks are steps away but be aware this neighborhood is pretty quiet past 11-midnight ish. There was a bar open until 4 just downstairs but rarely had more than a couple people in it and there's a 7-eleven steps away. The unit has great old wooden windows and wooden floors. The bathroom is huge and very comfortable. We were comfortable but the 3 bedrooms are tightly spaced and only 2 have actual beds at the moment. The kitchen is beautiful and new but we didn't stay long enough to use it, plus you would have to buy everything you need to cook besides the utensils and housewares. Be aware: no elevator and the unit is 2 flights up tiny stairs. I didn't get to meet Bogdan but he communicated well by phone to direct us in and out.
3553920	20753501	41917	20525551	Joyce	Our family had great  experience stay in Bogdanâ€™s apartment;  it has provided everything we need with neat, organized and well equipped, plus it has generous providing all the towel.       I love there the most it has no personal stuff in the apartment except furniture, it make you very easy pack what you belonging and left the apartment every morning. It did get noise on Friday night which woke up all of us, but we all agree would definitely stay there for our next visit.
3553920	21279726	41926	18228479	Manuel	Excellent apartment and host! 
3553920	21459665	41930	18226040	Kailey	"Bogdan was a great host. He helped us when we arrived and checked in to see how things were and if we needed anything. The location of the condo was great for commuting into downtown. The environment of the neighborhood was wonderful and we felt very comfortable in the condo. I would definitely go to Bogdan's ""home away from home"" again in the future. Thanks for being a great host! "
3553920	21940083	41939	9821017	Sabine	Lâ€™appartement est trÃ¨s propre, trÃ¨s fonctionnel, four, four Ã  micro-onde, toaster, lave-linge, sÃ¨che-linge, serviettes, torchons, tÃ©lÃ© Ã©cran plat, wifi â€¦ tout est rÃ©uni pour passer un excellent sÃ©jour.Il est situÃ© dans le quartier animÃ© de Lincoln parc, Ã  2 pas dâ€™Oz parc, 10 minutes Ã  pieds du Zoo de Lincoln parc, du lac  et Ã  5 minutes Ã  pieds de la station de train Armitage qui nous emmÃ¨ne directement dans le Loop.Plusieurs lignes de bus sont Ã©galement trÃ¨s proches et trÃ¨s pratiques.Comme certains lâ€™ont dÃ©jÃ  relevÃ©, le weekend le quartier peut Ãªtre un peu bruyant (pubs) mais la semaine, câ€™est calme.Bogdan a toujours rÃ©pondu prÃ©sent Ã  nos mails et nos demandes sur place.Nous sommes restÃ©s 9 jours et nâ€™avons pas eu le temps de nous ennuyer.Nous avons passÃ© un excellent sÃ©jour et remercions Bogdan pour cet appartement Ã  conseiller vivement.
3553920	22944076	41961	17515501	Michele	Casa bellissima, pulita e con ogni servizio e comfort che possa rendere piacevole il soggiorno. Bogdan Ã¨ molto disponibile e gentile. Ottima la posizione, in un quartiere ricco di locali e abbastanza vicino al Loop. 
3553920	23105794	41966	6466391	Matt	Awesome space, courteous host, and incredible access to the city. What more could you ask for?   If you're staying in the Windy City, this is a no-brainer.  Our experience couldn't have been better.
3553920	24354165	42000	19960805	Nicole	Nous avons passÃ© 10 jours excellents Ã  Chicago. Lâ€™appartement est spacieux, clair, confortable et particuliÃ¨rement bien situÃ© dans un quartier agrÃ©able et vivant. 2 lignes de mÃ©tro Ã  proximitÃ© et le bus devant la porte nous emmÃ¨nent rapidement dans le centre (bus vers le nord pour faire les courses : Walmart Ã  3/4 stations).Bogdan a Ã©tÃ© un hÃ´te discret mais toujours Ã  l'Ã©coute.
3553920	24845197	42007	23314888	Jen	Space was great for our group and we especially loved the kitchen and bathroom (heated floors were awesome)!  Bogdan was responsive and helpful with any questions that we had and there were plenty of towels, sheets, pillows, and basic amenities for us to use while we were there.  The neighborhood is great for walking to restaurants and shops.  The only issue we had was with the bar next door keeping us awake one of the nights due to noise though that obviously wasn't Bogdan's fault.  Would definitely recommend this place!
3553920	25889893	42032	21381680	Desiree	We had a great time staying at this beautiful place in Chicago.  We traveled with 2 very young children and the space was perfect for our whole family - clean, child friendly, and convenient.  We were traveling by car so the parking spot was perfect.  The home was clean and close to everything.  And most importantly of all Bogdan was very quick with responding to any question and a gracious host (although we never met in person he was clearly there to answer any questions or concerns).  We would definitely stay again. 
3553920	26597942	42051	14748479	Luz	I had an amazing time at Bogdan's Apartment in Chicago.  It was clean, beautiful and spacious; perfect for a long weekend.  The apartment was exactly as pictured, and the neighborhood was fantastic, right in the middle of many shops and restaurants.  We ended up spending one day just walking around exploring.  Bogdan was great, making us feel really welcome and I would defiantly stay her again.
3553920	26936431	42057	27066618	Diane	Bogdan was very helpful with questions we had and I would have to agree with all the other reviews. The place was clean. There is a bar next door that woke us up Fri and Sat night for about 30 min each night otherwise wed and thur night were quiet. Loved the coffee maker, tea and washer and dryer. Loved the tapas bar for a late lunch. Had a great stay and would stay there again.
3553920	27316929	42065	24006369	Mary	The description of the apartment was very accurate.  It was in a great location for us, very clean and and in good repair.  Lovely bathroom.  Comfortable beds.  
3553920	28385669	42086	19975387	Abigail	Awesome place! Updated throughout with new appliances and heated bathroom floor! Unexpected parking space was a nice surprise. A little late night noise from the restaurant/bar below but the amazing neighborhood more than made up for it. One bedroom door did not close, but this did not bother us at all. Place was very clean, host got back to us very quickly whenever we had questions. Would recommend this apartment, and hope it will be available for our next trip to Chicago. 
3553920	29287267	42100	514858	Jean-Philippe	Great spot in cool neighbourhood. Bogdan was very helpful and easy to deal with. Highly recommended.
3553920	29720711	42106	16380930	Vicki	Clean place, good neighborhood with lots of places to eat within walking distance.  The heated bathroom floor made me want to get one at my house.
3553920	30004803	42109	30972448	Richard	Exceeded all expectations!  Great location, beautiful apartment, gorgeous bathroom with bathtub, shower and heated floors.  Easy parking behind the building.I absolutely would return to Bogdan's Home Away from Home again. My first experience with AirBNB.  For sure, I'll be a repeat customer.
3553920	30278218	42114	171996	Matthew	This was one of the best AirBnB experiences I've had, if not the very best. The condo was immaculate and beautiful, the neighborhood perfect, the price was great, and Bogdan was remarkably responsive! The place was, if anything, even better than the pictures. When I'm back in Chicago next, I will look here first. Perfect AirBnB experience.
3553920	30598275	42119	24913167	Ronald	Bogdan's apartment was spacious, clean and well appointed. Amazing location with transit access to the loop and lots of fun dining and shopping opportunities. Bogdan was a great host to work with! He was prompt, attentive, and gracious. I highly recommend staying here if you are in Chicago!
3553920	31518041	42130	4565370	Patricia	Great location. Great apartment. Exceeded all expectations. Bogdan was very accommodating and we would look to stay here again. 
3553920	31770519	42134	14138476	Annie	This apartment for the price/location is pretty hard to beat. The kitchen and bathroom are newly renovated and look great. The bedrooms are on the small side but the living room is quite large. We stayed here for our annual girls trip, with 4 women in their early thirties and it was a great match for us. Yes there is noise from the bar downstairs but it was not so loud that is was an issue to fall asleep for anyone. Honestly for the price and location this place was fantastic. 
3553920	32064981	42137	21484906	Ivan	We have not meet Bogdan personally, but he always responded very promptly via Airbnb messages. The property is very nice, close to transportation and has parking. A very nice park with a playground only a block away, my son loved it. The apartment itself was tidy and comfortable. We enjoyed it! Many thanks to Bogdan!The apartment is situated on the third floor and the only access is narrow and steep stairs (there is no elevator), which should be considered by people with kids and elders. 
3553920	32492484	42143	16750130	Garrick	We had a great time staying in Bogdan's home in central Lincoln Park (perhaps Chicago's most trendiest neighbourhood these days).  The apartment is bright, modern and clean.  And comfortable too!  The kitchen and washroom were especially nice with upgraded finishes and amenities.  Bogdan communicated with us very well and offered all manner of tips on local food offerings, sightseeing and travel suggestions.  He was also very accommodating to an 11th hour addition to our party which helped us enjoy a wonderful weekend with family.  I would stay here again for sure.
3553920	33065120	42149	2076655	Danielle	Bogdan's apartment was lovely, spacious and easiy slept our family of five.  It's located right in the heart of Lincoln Park and a step away from a bunch of great shops, restaurants.  Lincoln Park and the zoo are about a ten minute walk away, with beautiful running paths and views of downtown Chicago.  The kitchen was spacious and the bathroom was luxurious.  Our only comment was that there was loud noise that woke us up around 2-3am each weekend night when one of the local bars let out.  
3553920	33448423	42152	17489519	Rebecca	Bogdan's apartment is beautiful and incredibly well located with the best breakfast place I've ever eaten at a stones throw away. After some initial hiccups getting into the apartment all was well and Bogdan was quite easy to get hold of. The amenities provided are great and the bathroom is better than the hotel we stayed at later in the week! The neighborhood has excellent shops, restaurants and bars and is just around the corner from a brown line station and a short walk from Oz Park. Would certainly stay again and recommend for groups as the apartment is HUGE!
3553920	33646941	42155	26711700	Nicholas	Perfect neighborhood, 5 minute walk to brown line. Spacious apartment with an amazing bathroom. The ONLY downfall to the apartment is the noise from the bar next door on Friday and Saturday nights. I'd recommend this place to anyone.
3553920	33992254	42158	2043326	Joanna	Thank you Bogdan! 7 of us were visiting Chicago for a few days and we booked both of Bogdan's apartments. It is in a very trendy area, within walking distance to metro, quirky shops and cafes. The Store is a bar with a nice vibe at night and Nookies Too is perfect for a hearty breakfast. The flats itself are also very well equipped, my bedroom door was slightly broken and Bogdan went out of his way to get it fixed even though it wouldn't have bothered me too much just for a few days. We've had a great time and will really recommend these apartments!
3553920	34403321	42163	27499870	Tj	The place was just as described and had everything we needed.  It was easy getting in and out.  You can't beat the location.  The bar below can be a little loud late at night but we only noticed it one of the four nights we were there.  A great place to stay!
3553920	34779494	42167	31483996	Pam	Bogdan's apartment was exactly as it was described-spacious, located in a wonderful, vibrant neighborhood and super convenient to everything-shopping, subway, dining.  The apartment was pristine and Bogdan checked in with me by phone AND email to make sure that everything was fine.  We highly recommend this apartment to anyone staying in Chicago!
3553920	35633816	42176	3506497	Jesse	Bogdan had a great place in an amazing location. We were only a few blocks from great food and transportation. Getting into the apartment was a breeze and it comfortably slept my family. I would definitely stay here again!
3553920	36018054	42179	1728274	Lisa	Bogdan made it super easy for us to get in/check out.  Place was clean and ready to go.  Nice space with high ceilings and large windows.  Sparsely decorated which was fine for us.  Great option for our brief trip of four friends meeting up in Chicago.  Loved the location!!  Very short (safe) walk to the Brown line (Armitage) and two bus stops just outside the front door.  So many fun shops and restaurants in the neighborhood - plan time to explore!  
3553920	36860346	42187	1334024	Amy	This was a wonderful apartment located in a safe and amazing area. The bathroom is huge and has a lovely shower head. The rooms were cozy yet spacious enough for luggage also. Will definitely recommend to any friends visiting who are looking for a centrally located, safe and clean spot. Thanks!!!
3553920	37295459	42191	29753260	Benjamin	Bogden's apartment was great.  The location was excellent, near lots of restaurants, bars and transportation - just a short trip from downtown.  Bogden made check-in very easy and was always quick to respond to any questions leading up to the trip.  
3553920	37844806	42196	31516586	Eileen	The apartment was exactly as pictured. It was a bit sparse, but very clean and had everything we needed. The neighbourhood is close to transit and has lots of restaurants and shops. It was a great place to stay while we were in Chicago.Bogdan was a very good host. He was very responsive to messages, made check-in simple, and checked with us after the first day to make sure everything was okay. One thing you can't tell from the listing is that one bedroom with a double bed is right off the kitchen, and because of the size of the room and the bed, the door doesn't close the whole way. This wasn't really an issue for us, but that might not be the case for everyone.Overall, though, we were very pleased with this apartment and would happily stay there again. Thanks Bogdan!
3553920	38369416	42200	5254178	Bob	The apartment was very nice and was in a very good neighborhood.  We were close to both bus and train service downtown.  There are a number of restaurants and bars close by.  The apartment has a dishwasher and a washer and dryer which was helpful.  
3553920	39144487	42206	27269988	Jim	I stayed in Bogdan's condo for a week of family vacation.  The location was a perfect launching point for all our activities around the city.  The Brown and Purple Line trains are very close by, Red Line is an easy walk, and bus stops are esentially right outside your door. The furnishings were simple but seemed to be good quality.  The bathroom and kitchen are both very impressive and function well. We really enjoyed having access to laundry machines.  Everything we needed was provided when we arrived - linens, towels, dish soap, kitchen supplies, and even a convenient and safe parking space, which we really needed.We never met Bogdan face to face, but he was always accessible and responsive by text or email. I was confident that if we had any issues, he would be able to help right away.  We didn't have any issues, though, so all the better for us.One word of caution, the bar next door can get really loud late nights on the weekend - like REALLY loud, and REALLY late. So if street noise is a concern, bring earplugs or be prepared to stay out and party with the kids at the Beaumont.  It only bothered us Friday night, and the place is completely closed on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.I would definitely recommend this home to friends and will try to stay there again if I'm lucky enough to return anytime soon!
3553920	39823110	42211	37841261	Terrence	My stay at Bogdan's place was great! The apartment was very clean and spacious. My three favorite things about the apartment: 1) the parking space, 2) the bathroom, and 3) the location. Also, having a fully stocked kitchen was a nice perk. I'll never stay in a hotel again thanks to this experience with Airbnb/Bogdan!
3553920	40478735	42216	3803483	Petra	We had a great time in Chicago. Bogdans appartment was perfect for us (2 adults and 2 Kids) it was easy to get in, Bogdan answered on every question within a very short time. The bedrooms are small but big enough to get a good Nights sleep. Kitchen and living-Room are big and have all you need. I liked the bathroom very much, a lot of space with a nice shower and washer and dryer which is very comfortable. So we will definatly stay again at Bogdans appartment when we come back to Chicago.
3553920	41308450	42223	26499901	Sylvain	it has been a magnifient travel,The condo was perfect and very well located.Close to the restaurants and train station.We have loved the confort of this condo. We suggest this condo for  familly of 6 or individual persons.Thank you! Bogdan.
3553920	43493187	42236	468802	Kasia	Bogdan's apartment was really wonderful and way above our expectations. Clean, roomy and had A/C, thank god! The area was perfect as well (proximity to subway, bar and 7 Eleven). I cannot recommend this place enough! 
3553920	43904564	42239	30163322	Jami	This is a great location! Lincoln Park is a very cool neighborhood. Bogdan was quick to respond to all inquiries and getting into the building was very easy. There is a late night bar next door, if you have someone staying in the front room (with the futon) it can be rather noisy but earplugs solved that problem. Overall, this place worked great for our stay.
3553920	45548811	42251	27234135	Nancy	The apartment was awesome.  Bogan checked in to make sure everything was going smoothly and that we didn't need anything.  Great experience. 
3553920	45923782	42254	7004371	MariePier	TrÃ¨s chouette appartement dans un quartier merveilleux. Lumineux, spacieux et trÃ¨s grand. L'endroit est idÃ©al pour les restaurant et le shopping. Bogdan s'est montrÃ© trÃ¨s patient et trÃ¨s sympathique avec nos multiples demande. 
3553920	47245321	42264	4121024	Nikki	We stayed at home from home with our 6 month old daughter and parents.  Bogdan made the check in process very easy and communicated all details well ahead of time. The apartment very clean, big and had everything you could need including a washer and dryer. It was in a great part of Chicago, close to parks and great places to eat. We loved our time and Chicago and would stay here again if we were to visit.
7309960	38963825	42204	6559967	Bonnie	Laura and Jack were super amazing. Very flexible with coordinating arrival and just all around awesome and friendly people. Thanks for the great stay!
7309960	39360896	42207	10798857	Christina	This old beautiful home is just as described. So cozy and relaxing. You'll be greeted by five super friendly beautiful cats and although there are so many of them, never sense of cat litter or hair anywhere .Laura is a great host, really easy going and helpful with places to check out.  Upon arrival I was starving, she recommended a place called Brothers diner that is located at  end of the block. Damn good food ;)  Great experience would totally stay there again. 
7309960	39865495	42211	38695609	Irene	My stay with Laura was great! Clean, cozy and comfy home. Laura made sure I got there fine and settled in. Comfy bed and private room looking out at the backyard. Had some nice talks with Laura and would recommending staying there. Enjoyed my Chicago stay very much! 
7309960	40521918	42216	39201181	Youn	We enjoyed staying at Laura's house. The room was cozy and the bed was soft. She was welcoming and friendly. She was willing to help us whenever we asked her about the area. She did not hesitate to let us use many stuffs at her house, even a bbq grill. We did enjoy staying at her house with her. 
7309960	41133513	42220	23297958	Danielle	Awesome place to stay! Laura and Jack are extremely welcoming. The house is very clean and nicely decorated. This is a great location with easy access to the blue line trains. There are 2 exceptional restaurants within a 2 block radius of the place, and a bus stop a block away. The cats are super chill and cuddly if you want them to be. If you stay here, you MUST go to Honey Butter Fried Chicken. It's among the best fried chicken I've ever had (and I'm from the south). All in all, Laura and Jack's house is a great place to call home for a few days.
7309960	41538084	42223	4816872	Allie	laura's house is absolutely beautiful and the roomwas lovely. she was extremely nice and made sure our stay was comfortable. she knows the area well and makes great recommendations. the cats are very sweet if you want to interact with them, and leave you alone if you're not interested. great place, great neighbourhood, very easy transit to downtown. would absolutely stay again! 
7309960	42056785	42226	40070314	Greg	A charming old home in a wonderful, quiet neighborhood.  The room was comfortable and met all our needs.  We enjoyed relaxing on the back patio and chatting with our gracious hosts. A very convenient and accessible location.
7309960	42488360	42229	35336116	Maria Isabel	We enjoyed staying at Laura's house. The room was clean and comfortable, met all our needs. Great location with easy access to transportation. Excellent place to stay, we would definitely stay there again. 
7309960	43007850	42232	41416564	Kimberly	Everything about the listing was completely accurate. It didn't take long to get to downtown Chicago and the neighborhood was nice. 
7309960	43726076	42237	16025970	Yuqing	Laura's place is clean, quiet and comfortable. There are various restaurants in the neighborhood within 10 min walk, and is close to a subway station. We did not get to meet them more because our stay was during weekdays, but we had a pleasant stay there. 
7309960	44481640	42242	26442752	Crystal	It was a very comfortable stay in Laura and Jack's house. The bedroom is very cozy and clean even with a chocolate on our pillow. Laura and Jack are very nice and welcome. She particularly prepared food for our breakfast which we really appreciate.Crystal
7309960	45029803	42246	40424714	Miree	They are very kind and sweet!The house has an air for comfort, and the room is clean & cozy.If I go to Chicago,  I want to stay there again. Their three friendly cats pleased us everyday! :) 
7309960	46960741	42261	39995421	Audrey	We would definitely stay at Laura and Jacks home again when visiting Chicago. Our room was comfortable and homey with little chocolates on the pillows when we arrived. They were very accommodating to our early arrival and late departure, which we greatly appreciated. Although we didn't see them much during our stay, as we were out and about, Laura and Jack were friendly and helpful, giving advice on transportation and local places to eat. Seemed like a nice couple who would be fun to hang out with. The blue line and bus are both just a few blocks away from their home and we felt safe walking to and from. Great  first airbnb experience.
3125185	14415178	41808	316829	Pat & Josh	We were in Chicago on a very busy weekend - graduations, blues fest, etc. and it was difficult to find any booking at all. We were not familiar with the neighborhood, but Immanuel's place turned out to be just right. We were able to find free parking on the street. Some days we took the El (very convenient- just a couple blocks away) for a day in the city, other days we could use the car for trips north to Evanston. The neighborhood is very charming, quiet, lined with trees and well maintained brick apartment buildings, close to the lake, a grocery store and interesting ethnic restaurants. The building entrance is along a pretty landscaped path set back from the street. Immanuel met us right on time, left welcome fresh flowers and fruit, and gave us some great recommendations for local restaurants. (excellent swedish pancakes...). He was a wonderful and gracious host.The apartment is really quite spacious, with windows on opposite sides so there was great natural light and breeze all day. It's a period building, with authentic 1930's charm and architectural details, (and also 1930's water pressure) and simply furnished. We didn't want a posh or hotel-like experience so it was perfect for us.  A great airbnb experience. Better than expected.  Highly recommended.
3125185	14939904	41819	10468051	Corey	Immanuel's place was great! He accepted the request quickly and met me the next day. He was very kind and explained everything to me. He was great about communicating and checking in periodically. He even recommended some local restaurants. His place was peaceful and very clean. I would love to stay here again!
3125185	15656372	41833	878813	Gregg	Immanuel was a great host. I took him up on his offer for an airport pickup, and he was nice even when my two hour flight was an hour and a half late.The place looks a lot nicer & brighter than the online photos - it's clean, spacious and has good cross ventilation (though he has a/c & a big fan) on a beautiful, green suburban street in the Loyola U area. Hallway and two-floor walkup was nice, bed was comfortable.It's a quick and (despite one divey bar) nice walk to the El, and the 7-11 (a five-seven minute walk in other direction) was convenient as well. The walk straight over to the lake was quick, and the spot was amazing. Only issue was the water pressure being low (but manageable) and realizing there wasn't wifi -- my mistake for not checking, but I'm glad I didn't, or I might've missed out on a nice place.Immanuel was helpful at every step of the way--with basic amenities, offering an umbrella when it rained, at checkout. He was responsive each of the few times I needed to contact him. I'd highly recommend this place.
3125185	16044423	41840	12776310	John	Immanuel was a gracious host and his place was conveniently located
3125185	16268600	41844	13017125	Jesse	I had a wonderful stay at Immanuel's apartment. He met me at check in exactly as planned, and responded promptly to the few questions I had for him during my stay.The space was clean, bright, and roomy. I made liberal use of the nearby beaches, Red Line, and restaurants. As others have mentioned, it is worth noting that the water pressure was very low during my stay.I would definitely recommend Immanuel's apartment.
3125185	17011126	41856	10980613	Rasheed	Its 2 weeks before Lollapalooza weekend and I haven't figured out where I'm staying. The hotels were extremely expensive. I decided to try Airbnb and it was awesome. Immanuel was very nice and welcoming. Definitely would book with Immanuel again!
3125185	17248135	41860	19358917	Timothy	Immanuel accepted my request at the very last minute and picked me up from the airport, although my already late arrival was delayed by two hours. The apartment is very big, bright and clean. Shops, restaurants, the train and everything you need is easily reached on foot. The neighborhood is very nice and downtown is just a quick train ride away. I would definitely recommend staying at Immanuel's.
3125185	17418822	41862	15346232	Jan-Ulrik	Immanuel is a very polite guy and a very good host. i booked the apartment very spontaneous and it is worth to mention that the communication with him was very good. The apartment is located on the red line in the north of Chicago. Trains are going there regularly, the neighborhood is quiet and nice. The apartment is absolutely cosy, clean, comfortable and very convenient for 2 people, a bit clairaudient though. The only handicap is the shower, which doesnt work properly since only very few drops come out of the shower head.
3125185	18694247	41881	3761298	Filipe	Immanuel was a very personal and hospitable host.  He asked me what my interests were and made sure to have a handwritten list of recommendations....WHAT???!!!  Now that's personal service!  How many people actually take the time to put pen to paper and write anything anymore!  His reception, attentiveness, and congeniality was very appreciated!
3125185	19626955	41897	20369641	Paulina	The apartments is located in a nice neighborhood by a college area, very cosy and comfy. The host Immanuel is very nice and checks on you to see if everything is ok. I will for sure come back again!
3125185	19973363	41903	21140589	Michael	Immanuel is an excellent host and made us feel at home during our stay.  He was very accommodating meeting us late at night to give us the key and show us around the apartment.  He had towels, soap and extra blankets for us.  The apartment was very clean and as advertised.  I recommend staying at Immanuel's.Michael
3125185	20374639	41910	21294390	Ganesh	I had a great time at Immanuel's place. He greeted me and waited for a long time for my arrival was delayed due to airport issues. The apt was clean and everything was as promised and mentioned in the ad. I will certainly come back here and recommend to others.
3125185	21038104	41922	9738852	Adrie	Immanuel is een vriendelijke hulpvaardige gastheer. Het appartement is gelegen in een mooie groene rustige straat met op loopafstand het strand en het openbaarvervoer....kortom bedankt Immanuel en voor herhaling vatbaar.
3125185	21145677	41924	21107387	Becky	Good host, always responds promptly to questions. Nice apartment, very clean. Good location. 
3125185	22215805	41944	1417670	Jerry	Great apartment in great north Chicago location.  If you want to be near Andersonville or Rogers park consider this place.  Communication was easy as well as check in and check out.
3125185	23380760	41973	23026666	ViR	Immanuel was very kind! The apartment was clean, close to the metro and in a safe neighborhood (as descripted). If I have another opportunity Iâ€™ll stay in Emmanuelâ€™s house. I strongly recommend Emmanuel!  
3125185	31790090	42134	29931905	Mary	We stayed at Immanuel's place for our daughter's graduation and while helping her pack up her apartment. It was a very convenient location for us in a quiet neighborhood. Being on the third floor of the building no doubt added to the quiet - we slept great! Immanuel met us at the apartment and was very welcoming. We are familiar with the area, so we did not need a lot in terms of recommendations, etc., but he offered them. The apartment is in an older building but is very clean and bright with good air flow (and as I mentioned, quiet). It was as advertised and we had everything we needed. I only wish we had found it earlier. 
3125185	32207971	42139	6834842	Stacy	Immanuel was fantastic. The place was very clean and is just as described. There is no WiFi, which is something to note if you need to have it while you stay. There's a coffee shop on Devon that is very nearby, so that is a great option if you need to get access and you have no other means. I used my phone's tethering. The building is indeed a 1930s, lovely, lovely place. With poor water pressure! In the shower I did not find this to be a problem, but I did quite a bit of cooking while I was there, and it was a bit tricky. Lastly, parking is a bit of a problem, as you cannot park on Glenwood at all. I sometimes had to park over 1/2 a mile away. Anyway, I would totally stay again. The area is so nice.
3125185	32377199	42141	25273132	Anne	The neighborhood was fantastic! It was super convenient to Loyola's Lake Shore Campus and anyone you passed on the street would wave and say hello! Immanuel was a fantastic host. He was flexible on check in time and then met me and my parents at the flat to explain all the amenities, give directions, and provide my parents with fresh fruit. Admittedly Chicago has temperamental spring/summer weather and as it had just decided to warm up there was no window unit, however this was no problem at all! There is a great ceiling fan in the living room, Immanuel provided a box fan for the bedroom, and there is fabulous cross breeze throughout the house being so near the lake. I would definitely recommend Immanuel's flat for anyone looking to stay near the El, near Loyola Lake Shore Campus, or anyone wanting to be near the lake. It's just lovely. 
3125185	33824941	42156	30119766	Gary	Immanuel was a great host and made sure everything was in place prior to my arrival.  The apartment is in a quiet, residential area, just a few mins walk away from the Red Line.  
3125185	34321617	42162	32978714	Meggie	Immanuel was warm, welcoming, accommodating  and communicated promptly. The apartment was well-kept, clean, sunny, and charming! I liked the space very much. The neighborhood was quiet, safe with easy access to the CTA. A great place to stay!
3125185	35060468	42170	26251300	Lars	I stayed a week with my two kids and had a wonderful time. Immanuel was very helpful and a great host. The flat is very functional with two rooms and a kitchen with table and chairs. The neighborhood is nice. Please note no WiFi. You would need a Us credit card to purchase access to xfinity provided wifi. A nice Starbucks near by with wifi solved the problem for us. I am happy to give Immanuel and this flat me best recommendations. Best regards Lars Fogh (Denmark)
3125185	36565449	42184	5588526	Chris	"This review is from my mother who stayed here while she was in town visiting me.  We tried to reach out to airbnb twice during her stay and got no response.  Below is what she had to say about the apartment: I arrived late the first night ~ 8:00PM.  I called Immanuel upon arrival and was told the apartment wasn't ready yet.  He needed another half hour or so to finish cleaning. No big deal.  I returned a little after 9:00PM.  The host was very nice, helped me with my bags, and showed me around the apartment.  The next morning I was looking for a toaster and pan to make breakfast. No toaster. No working can opener. I improvised.  The next day I'm looking to make a smoothy and didn't find a blender.  I called Immanuel.  He showed up within hours and brought over a toaster, found the blender, and also discovered the can opener didn't work. I did not call him again, because after staying two nights it was clear this apartment is more for rental purposes than him living there.  If he stayed there regularly he would know its shortcomings. The apartment is over priced for its ""amenities"". There was no WiFi; the hot water faucet in the kitchen did not work so boiling water was the only way to clean the dishes; no counter space; the handles and tops of the appliances were tacky and dirty from grease; the bathroom had a large water bubble/crack in the ceiling and the walls had large pieces peeling away from them. He told me there was a recent water leak in bathroom.  The hot water faucet in tub area was very tricky. Did not work by itself, had to figure out how cold side impacted hot. The shower curtain was not wide enough to completely enclose the tub/shower area. I got water on the floor twice. Last day of seven had the best water flow. The sink faucet in bathroom worked well. It was the only 'newer' faucet in the apartment. Now I don't expect central air in Chicago, but if you want people to open the windows, then you should wipe down the sills and frames. They were very dirty. Parking on this street is by permit only.  I arrived late one evening and it took forty minutes to find a parking spot.  Thankfully it's a very nice and safe neighborhood, so I wasn't afraid to find my way back to the apartment.  The apartment was indeed cozy (code for small), and is fine for one or two people."
3125185	37485204	42192	824808	Inger	The apartment was not ready when we arrived. We were disappointed as to the actual quality of the apartment. There were many small problems not listed in the ad, such as exposed rusted metal in the tub, extremely squeaky floors which were very loud at night, the water pressure and temperature were unreliable, and some things which were much less clean than you would expect. The host missed one very unsanitary item in his cleaning up from the previous guests. All in all, we felt like we paid too much for what we got. In general, the host was apologetic, but not accommodating.
3125185	37927692	42196	5712586	Amy	Immanuel was a wonderful host. He was very easy to make arrangements with and was kindly accommodating of our arrival time, even though I underestimated how long the train would take! He met us at the apartment (which was very charming, in a neighborhood full of beautiful gardens, and just right for our trip), gave us the grand tour, and directed us to a cool restaurant and a coffee shop, both of which we visited during our stay. The apartment is in a neighborhood I'd never visited, but am glad to be familiar with now. It's close to a train stop, a bookshop, and the lake!
3125185	38336544	42199	658203	Neal	Immanuel was not available when we arrived, but he did have a friend let us in and show us around. The flexible check in and check out times were huge! He stayed in touch during our stay, which was appreciated.  Immanuel's place is located in a great little area that was quiet at night.  A nice place to stay! 
3125185	46044457	42254	10280598	Kevin	Immanuel s  apartment was exactly as advertised, the kitchen was equipped adequately so a guest could prepare breakfast, lunch or dinner. He was also very flexible when it came to checking in and out which was very helpful when delays are part of one's trip.Just one note,the bathroom could use an update and to get a balance of hot and cold in the shower could be tricky.
3125185	47847804	42268	13353288	Rich	I highly recommend Immanuel's place.  Awesome location.  Just a couple of blocks from the red line.  Place is spacious and so much character.  Very quite neighborhood too.  I hope to stay again soon.  Thanks Immanuel!  Rich 
983330	13597875	41791	3758139	Sonia	OJ was a great host, the other room mates were cool and easy to get along with. The location was great, accessible to both Hyde park and Jackson park hospital. The house was quite which made for great studying. The rooftop access was a nice perk. Parking was always convenient and easy. The YMCA and grocery store were only a couple of blocks away. Overall staying at OJ's was a really great.experience.We would recommend to any one, especially other MD students rotating in hospitals in the S. Chicago area.Thx OJ! 
2943801	13118891	41778	7038250	Lisa	The building is secure and has a great energetic vibe since it's occupied by a young, professional demographic.  The location is excellent since it's close to several modes of transportation (bus, subway, bike share) and is central to take off in any direction when exploring Chicago. And Kaushal's fabulous view?  It's true, it's great at any time of the day! Kaushal is a gracious host, easy going, considerate and quick to reply.  I'd recommend his flat to anyone.  My weekend in Chicago was a lot of fun and I look forward to exploring it more.
2943801	14136965	41802	16317256	Kurtis	I stayed at Kaushall's place for 2 nights. He's a super nice guy, the apartment is nice, and the view is as advertised!
2943801	21904440	41938	4005690	Michelle	My stay at Kaushal's place was great. It was very close to the amtrak. View was beautiful. I didn't know there would be an air bed, but it was very comfortably made, so no worries there. Kayshal was also able to meet me at the amtrak so that was very nice.

His flat has supreme night view and is located very accessible to anyplaces, especially Amtrak. I stayed one night here, but as I'll visit Chicago next time, I'll stay here!!
2943801	32282241	42140	5340152	Rolf	Kaushal was great to work with! His communication was quick and he did a great job of taking care of the space. The location was phenomenal and the benefit of meeting an interesting person made the experience even better.
2943801	33050236	42148	5812439	Jin	Kaushal, a very easy-going and nice guy. He accommodated to my requests and was very helpful. It was a short notice and he made sure his place was spotless. I told him I wasn't a near freak just as long as there wasn't any pubic hair in the bathroom I would be happy. He got the humor. Had a nice stay. The view of the city from his apt was AWESOME.
2943801	33633917	42154	21194000	Stephanie	Kaushal is a fantastic host! I would highly recommend this place for your West Loop stay. The room has a beautiful view from the 33rd floor overlooking downtown Chicago. You're close to the river so walk around and enjoy the beautiful stroll! Extreme convenience. Transportation (train, subway, bus stops) are all nearby. You're above a Walmart and on the same block as dozens of solid places to grab a quick bite Chipotle, Potbelly's, smoothies, pizza, sandwiches, etc. The only downside is because you're in a business district, restaurants seem to close semi-early. Very safe location. Area is very well lit and feels like there are always people walking and running around at night.Kaushal is a kind and considerate host. He is happy to give directions or recommendations on places to go. He is respectful of your schedule so you're always welcome to do your own thing but also makes himself available just to chat and hang out. A gemstone find and definitely one of the lowest rates in the area. Snag this place for your travel dates before someone else does :)
479402	5618205	41463	7005147	Andrew	Great deal, 3-4 stops from the Loop on the L.   If you're want the posh Chicago downtown experience, get out your wallet and stay downtown.  Pilsen is a real Chicago neighborhood.  Lee's apartment is a real Chicago home on the Lower West Side.  If you're driving in, you can park on the street instead of paying $20+ per night for a spot downtown and don't miss Carnitas Uruapan on your way to the 18th Street L stop.
479402	6278183	41492	5316176	GermÃ¡n	The apartment is exactly as described, spacious and full of light. We really enjoyed our stayed there. Thanks Lee!!Only two details for future guests:- The place is up one flight of stairs and there's no elevator.- Lee has a dog, and even though the apartment was really clean, you can still find some hair in the corners or under the furniture (when moving the couches).These things were not a problem for us but could be a deal breaker for someone.
479402	6515373	41501	278719	Ju Dee	We had a great stay here. The apartment is lovely, comfortable and sun-lit. The Damen stop of the pink el line is nearby (esp if you use the entrance/exit on Hoyne), which is very convenient for getting to/from the Loop, and we really enjoyed being near Pilsen too (amazing Mexican food). Street parking is plentiful and free. Lee was very communicative throughout (and we enjoyed meeting her dog too). We would stay here again!
479402	6650267	41505	80057	Cora	I had a great stay at Lee's place. She was very accommodating and   the location of her apartment was just close enough to downtown. Pilsen is a great neighborhood and we really felt at home. Lee also has a really great selection of books I might add!
479402	7013149	41520	7163669	Tim & Lisa	We had a great stay at Lee's place, everything was as described and clean!  We walked 10min to the Divvy bike station and rode them to the downtown area and around for the day which was great.  Lee suggested we go to Honky Tonk BBQ down the road and it was really good as well!  Parking was not an issue on the street, we were always able to find a spot within sight of the apartment building.  Communication with Lee was never an issue and she had clean sheets and towels ready for us upon arrival, would definitely stay again!  Thanks Lee!   
479402	7590808	41542	8856477	Alejandra	Lee's apartment is delightful. Beautifully decorated, super comfortable and clean. Lee was also a great friendly host. Very easy to communicate  to. We left an ipod at her place and she mailed it to us without charge! I'd highly recommend staying at Lee's apartment.  
479402	9370093	41632	1402110	Matthew And Jennifer	We loved our time in Chicago!!!!Lee's apartment is a gem!  We thoroughly enjoyed our time in Pilsen!Parking is easy and free! The apartment was cozy and warm!She has the best collection of books :)The location is great! It was easy to find and is about 10 minutes away from the loop by car!I would highly recommend Lee's apartment if you are heading to Chicago!!
479402	11764806	41743	6172041	Ivana	Had a very happy, peaceful stay at Lee's. The apartment itself was beautiful, cozy, and clean. It's definitely spacious enough for a couple, though 3 or 4 people could feasibly share the apartment as well. This part of Pilsen was quiet and seemed relatively safe. Though I didn't meet Lee in person, she was very quick to answer any questions or concerns that came up throughout my stay. My boyfriend and I stayed for a week and didn't have any problems. We felt comfortable and very at-ease the whole time. We didn't have a car but had no trouble getting around on the CTA. I used the pink line, which stops very close to the apartment, to get downtown where I could easily transfer to other trains and buses on my way to various Chicago neighborhoods, and I took the Damen bus, which stops just down the street from Lee's, to ride up to Wicker Park a few times. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Chicago. You can avoid paying high hotel prices without sacrificing privacy. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat. 
479402	12051298	41751	9017819	Marion	TrÃ¨s bon sÃ©jour dans l'appartement de Lee.L'appartement est conforme aux photos du site mÃªme si l'entrÃ©e de l'immeuble est un peu vÃ©tuste. L'intÃ©rieur est cozy et trÃ¨s propre. Tout y est pour passe u sÃ©jour comme a la maison. Le quartier mexicain est calme et le mÃ©tro est a 5 minutes Ã  pied, le mÃ©tro se rend dans le loop en 15min!! Nous n'avons pas vu Lee mais il est trÃ¨s  facile et rapide de communiquer avec elle par mails. 
479402	12268992	41757	11365018	Sean	Lee's apartment had us feeling right at home!The super cozy space and friendly neighborhood made for an A+ weekend vacation.  Parking was easy and free!There are several authentic Mexican restaurants and taquierias within a few blocks.The Pink line is about a 10 minute walk from the apartment.  Take the pink line towards the loop where you can transfer onto other lines.Catching a Taxi from downtown ran us only $15-$20. I would recommend Lee's apartment to everyone visiting Chicago.Can't wait to visit again!
479402	12465299	41762	2328579	CaycÄ±e	Great place, very beautiful and clean. It is a few blocks from the Pink Line and allows for easy access to buses for Wicker Park, Bucktown, etc. Very charming mix of residential and business Mexican community. Thanks again Lee!
479402	12660817	41766	13592467	Maciej	Lee's apartment is very beautiful, clean and cosy. It is located a couple blocks from the pink line Damen station (~7min walk) that goes to the Loop. The same distance is between the apartment and the Western Station (Metra Train) which is the easiest and the cheapest way to get to Aurora if you plan to do some shopping in Chicago Premium Outlets (100km from Chicago) - it took us 75 minutes to get to Aurora by train (in Aurora you can take a cab from the train station to Chicago Premium Outlets). With some nice Mexican restaurants in the neighborhood you wonâ€™t complain about the places to eat (unless you donâ€™t like cuisine of this kind). We also recommend Honky Tonk BBQ (15min from Leeâ€™s apartment). We would stay here again.Thanks Lee!
479402	12778551	41770	12842223	Lucas & Feline	We had a lovely stay in Chicago! Lee was wonderful as a host, very organized and so easy to communicate with! And the apartment was just perfect, clean, spacious..it truly felt like home away from home!
479402	12922055	41773	369477	Jenn	Lee's place was fantastic! It was easy to find, in a great location and was perfect. The place is big and bright with a very comfortable bed. It had everything we needed and was very charming.Lee is a great host and we had no problem finding the place. Her instructions are very clear and she was very accommodating and flexible.Thanks for letting us stay in such a beautiful apartment in a great neighbourhood.
479402	13177043	41780	12132111	Meghan	Lee's place was clean and as advertised. Only a 5 minute walk from the Pink Line which was nice, and numerous close bus stops. She recommended GREAT places to eat! Would totally recommend or stay at Lee's place again. Thanks!
479402	13285385	41783	13999894	Amparo	Lee's place is very nice and convenient located, very close to the Pink Line which takes you to the Loop in about 15 min. She was very nice and friendly giving tips about the neighbourhood. 100% recomendable!
479402	14704925	41814	16076519	Julio	"This apartment is exactly what you see in the photos. Rarely do you ever come across ""what you see is what you get"". The apartment was lovely and Lee was very accommodating despite me mixing up the date and time of stay. Parking can always be found within a 1 block radius, even if you get home late and have to park on the side street. If you're looking for a good place to stay but don't want to pay the inflated rates some places charge (and have no parking) stay here, you will also feel right at home. P.S. this apartment is perfect if you land at Midway, easy to get to as well."

479402	16073542	41842	5639324	John	Lee's apartment was just fantastic. This was not my first time in Chicago, but I hadn't yet explored Pilsen - it's a beautiful neighbourhood with great food and sights, and Lee is right in the middle of it. It was also incredibly easy for us to move around the city using CTA, with a station just two blocks away. The apartment itself was inspired and inviting. I would absolutely stay here again and would recommend it to anyone visiting Chicago for any length of time.
479402	16322861	41845	16114626	Marzinho	Lee's place was great, a little away from the Loop (centre of town) but an easy, shortish metro ride in on Pink Line. Located in a Latino district, with great Mexican food and other amenities nearby. Pilsen has the feel of a laid back family type area, friendly and safe. It's probably a little away from the action on West Division, Milwaukee and Northside, but nothing insurmountable by cab (get Uber or the like in Chicago, cabs can be $$$). Lee was a very amicable and accommodating host, particularly with respect to check in and check out. Also, great rainfall shower! Fell in love with Chicago, and would highly recommend this place!
479402	16449244	41848	11840306	Pierre	L'appartement de Lee est bien situÃ©, dans un quartier proche du Loop, auquel on accÃ¨de aisÃ©ment en mÃ©tro, en quelques minutes. Excellente boulangerie mexicaine! L'entrÃ©e de l'immeuble est vÃ©tuste, mais l'appartement est bien amÃ©nagÃ© dans un style vintage. Seule critique : l'appartement convient pour deux personnes, mais pas pour quatre : il n' y a qu'un lit double et les deux divans sont trop petits pour faire des lits convenables, sauf pour des trÃ¨s petits enfants. De mÃªme, il n'y a que deux tabourets autour de la table de la cuisine. Donc, trÃ¨s bien pour deux personnes. Nous n'avons pas vu Lee, mais elle a toujours rÃ©pondu trÃ¨s rapidement et gentiment Ã  nos mails.
479402	17783569	41868	2800070	Gloria	Lee was a great hostess and very  quick to respond to texts and questions about the city. We loved the family neighborhood. The apartment was in an old small apartment building. The apartment was an oldie but goodie- beautiful sunshine and very light. Note that is is on the second floor - you will be climbing stairs and that the apartment is older.  Parking was awesome (and free!) a nice little perk. Close to transportation . A good value for the price!
479402	18618778	41880	16031608	ClÃ©mentine	We were very Happy to stay in the lovely Lee's appartement!
479402	19265680	41891	16391418	Kevin	A wonderful apartment in a great location! Number one, the bed was super comfy. I always worry about getting a poor night's sleep when out of town, but we had no worries here. Two, being four blocks away from the L train station and within two blocks of two different bus routes made getting into the city and to/from Midway an absolute breeze. Three, the neighborhood was quiet, the people we bumped into were friendly, there's a tiny grocery across the street for a few staples, and the cafe down the street (Vio) was yummy! (Bonus fact about the location for tall people only: on your tiptoes, you can see the Willis Tower from the bathroom window!) Lastly, Lee herself was very helpful, always quick to respond to an email, and it was clear she wanted to make sure we were happy with our stay.Here's the best compliment I can give: We will look to stay here again when we come back to Chicago! 
479402	19668975	41898	354868	Virginie	It was our fifth time using AirBnb and our first misadventureâ€¦ We had some doubts before our arrival but we thought we'd see by ourselves and reviews were good so we were optimistic. A few hours before our arrival, Lee told us about exterminators she had called about roaches... Not reassuring. The apartment is quite well furnished but the building is in very poor condition and cleanliness in the appartement wasn't that good. There was dust and little rocks on books on the shelves, some more dust on the pansâ€¦Â But we thought it could be okay for just spending the night there. Roaches appeared the next evening and that was it. We weren't feeling comfortable in the appartement until then and this was what made us leave for good. We left to stay in an hotel 30 minutes away from downtown and canceled our second stay that was planned a week later. It ruined the first days of our vacation in the city and we lost money. Too bad. The appartement and neighborhood may suit some people. Not us.
479402	20058885	41904	16471150	Luiz	We were pleased with the location of the apt with it's accessibility to the train station (5-7 minute walk) which had you in the heart of downtown within about 20 minutes.  If you enjoy Mexican food, the restaurant Vios about 3 blocks down on the same street was great for breakfast.  Also, Lee was very accessible and ready to answer our questions at a moments notice. Thanks!While the apt itself was definitely clean, it seemed that the condition of the walls and fixtures in the house were different than the pictures, particularly speaking on the condition of the bathroom and building that the apartment is in. The building is very old and makes all kinds of noises throughout the night. If you are a light sleeper, this may not be for you. 
479402	20218402	41907	6696805	Niki	The apartment was very nice, artistic, cozy, super comfortable bed, all exactly like in a picture. Lee as a host was perfect, always attending fast to all our responses. 7 min walking from house there is metro station pink line which in 10 min takes you directly to the center of Chicago. We had pleasant stay in her house, and would recommend it to anyone! 
479402	20410281	41911	4349649	Kamini	The apartment was very spacious and clean, and the neighbourhood was great! Easy to get around by Transit, and all amenities were close by - Lee's recommendations for food and coffee in the neighbourhood were very helpful. I especially enjoyed all the inexpensive Mexican food.
479402	20898131	41919	18997602	Leah	Our stay at Lee's was wonderful! It was very easy to find her place. A very cozy, well-kept space, it fit Lee's description exactly. We also found transportation to be easy to access--just a quick walk to the bus or the Pink line and we were in the main city within 15 minutes. It was an excellent location; the neighborhood maintained both a family and a city feel, which we loved. We did have a problem starting the heater (due to exceptionally cold temperatures), but it was quickly resolved by Lee. With such excellent service and accommodations, we would go back in a heartbeat!  Thanks so much, Lee! :)
479402	21194339	41925	11233016	Diego	"We enjoyed a lot staying at Lee's place. The apartment is very cozy and it has several touches of individuality. The description is accurate and Lee was an excellent host getting in touch with us to ensure all was ok. Also staying in Pilsen made a lot of fun, as you can see a ""different"" (and super nice) part of Chicago that you might miss if you stay directly in the Loop area. All in all, excellent experience ;)"
479402	21654404	41933	1200383	Paulo	Lee was always very responsive and helpful. The photos do not exactly match the conditions of the apartment, which in reality is older and a bit dusty. The building (as Lee describes in her profile) is really old and a bit scary. In terms of public transportation, it is located about 7 minutes walking from Damen station (metro pink line), which takes you to the Loop in about 15minutes. If one is going to the convention center, there is a direct bus line (number 21) from the corner of Damen and Cermak, whih takes about 20minutes.
479402	22367595	41947	22092507	Mollie	Charming, charming, charming!  We truly enjoyed our stay.  One of the best things about our trip was relaxing in this cozy, artistic apartment.  Lee, our host, was amazing -- she got up in the middle of the night to come check out a problem we thought we were having with the gas wall heater!  (turned out it was dust -- they came and cleaned it out in the morning for us -- no big problem)
479402	22592732	41953	20364595	Sabrina	My boyfriend and I spent a wonderful long weekend at LeeÂ´s place. The place is really cozy and we felt very welcome. ItÂ´s spacious, has a very comfortable bed and matched the pictures! Communication with Lee was very easy and she was always responsive - we had some troubles figuring out how the heater worked and she came by shortly after. ItÂ´s located close to the Pink Line, which takes you to the Loop within 20 minutes. There are some great Mexican places close to the apartment which are definitely worth a visit! We would definitely come back and recommend the place to everyone planning to visit Chicago!
479402	22909737	41960	5587522	Cory	Lee's place is awesome! My boyfriend and I had a wonderful time staying in her apartment. She had thought through our stay, the place was clean and ready when we arrived. Her apartment is just a short walk from many restaurants. I would definitely stay here again! 
479402	23105298	41966	9797805	Rune	We had a great time staying at Lee's place in Pilsen. It's close to CTA and it's a cozy apartment. Communication was excellent. We arrived late in kind of a hurry, and got 18th St and 18th Pl mixed up, but Lee helped sort it out.
479402	23328372	41972	5860409	Brent	Lee was a great and helpful host, and the place was beautiful. We thoroughly enjoyed spending thanksgiving here and were happy to have stayed here for our trip to Chicago. 
479402	23466978	41974	23874696	Nathalia	Very comfy apartment. Lee made us feel like we were home and the apartment is just great! It takes approximately 30 min to get to downtown but subway station is very close to the apartment.
479402	23527170	41976	23073093	John-Paul	Lee's apartment is as advertised: a cosy refuge in a new city. We felt at home and comfortable while we were there, like we were staying at a dear friend's place. It is clean, the bed was comfortable and warm. We really enjoyed the ride down town on the L  - great views over the rooftops. Lee was quick to pick up the phone and respond to text messages, and a pleasure to interact with. There is an issue with the heater: it smells faintly of gas when in use. Lee indicated that it was perfectly safe.  provided a space heater and said that she is trying to fix the unit.  
479402	23905938	41987	8886393	Laura	Such a beautiful place to stay! Very charming and clean with lots of personality. Lee made us feel so welcome, she checked in during our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. The building and neighborhood were a bit rough and worn down, so we were nicely surprised by how nice the apartment was. Located near trains to both the airport and downtown, we could not have asked for a better place to stay. 
479402	24624249	42004	21615727	Jay	We had an amazing time, Lee was a fabulous host. No problems at all. 
479402	24757190	42006	4110720	Max	Lee's apartment was a great place to spend a weekend.  It was clean and comfortable, warm during chilly weather, and conveniently located in walking distance of the El.  I didn't meet Lee in person, but she was super helpful getting the wifi service restored when it cut out.  Good shower, too.  Recommended.
479402	27970624	42078	28971937	Brian	Even though Lee was not there when I arrived, she made every effort to make sure that I was comfortable and felt at home!  The apartment was even better than the posted description!  The building was quiet but the apartment was full of life.  Lee's communication the entire weekend was quick and helpful.  The whole experience was GREAT!  I would stay here again!  Thank You! 
479402	28341516	42085	27130926	Frank	Though Lee's apartment was in a very old building, she made it full of characters with hanging paintings/pictures and other interesting decors. We feel grateful for staying in her apartment for 4 nights. The apartment is next to a railway and 10 minutes from a pink line station. But we hardly heard any traffic noise at night. The neighborhood is vibrant with cheap and great eats during the day and is surprisingly quiet during the night. 
479402	29081081	42097	9871130	Gabriel	The apartment was clean and cozy, artsy and comfortable. The Wifi, basic cable, French press coffee, and nearby restaurants and grocery were also very convenient. Lee was sweet, very accommodating, and responded to my text questions quickly. I would definitely stay there again. 
479402	29862151	42107	27975999	Lillie	We really enjoyed our stay at Lee's apartment. It was clean and the bed was cozy and comfortable. Lee is an outstanding host. She responded to us quickly whenever we needed help and was was flexible in assisting our check-in process!  This was our first Airb&b experience and because of Lee we will use the site for all of our getaways. I hope when we return to Chicago next year we can stay with her again!
479402	30306123	42114	6841077	Julia	lee was super helpful and communicative since the day we sent the request. She replied super quick and tried to help as much as possible.  The flat was lovely,  greatly decorated, sunny and just around the corner from the pink line that takes us downtown.  We enjoyed our stay at Lee's and would totally recommend it to anyone.
479402	30512517	42117	2641984	Jennifer	Lee's place was perfect for a quiet few days getaway.  It's a beautiful apartment with lots of natural light and comfy  places to sit, and an easy walk to the Pink Line (Damen) for getting downtown or to the rest of Chicago.  The building is quiet and as a woman on my own in a city I don't know, I felt safe coming back late at night.  There's easy street parking for those with cars.  Lee was quick to respond to any questions I had.  Highly recommended.
479402	30782842	42121	180106	Ross	We had a wonderful stay at Lee's place.  Very easy check-in and check-out process.  She was very quick to respond to messages.
479402	31452575	42129	1281859	Katherine	Lee was very helpful and ensured we were happy once the holiday began. The apartment is lovely and is in a great location; easy walk to the train to get to the centre of Chicago and to buses to get to other areas. It was fully equipped with everything we could possibly need and more. I would definitely stay here again should we re-visit Chicago!
479402	31800245	42134	1465178	Fabiana	Todo estuve bien, acorde a lo publicado. El dpto era cÃ³modo, calefaccionado, pudimos usar la cocina, la licuadora, elementos de la cocina, etc. El barrio es muy tranquilo, volviamos tarde y nunca tuvimos ningun problema. AdemÃ¡s durante la noche no habia ruidos ni en el barrio ni en el edificio. Es muy cerca de la estaciÃ³n Damen, y de alli al Loop sÃ³lo 20 minutos. Espero que haya sido util la opiniÃ³n. 
479402	32069211	42137	1505964	Kayla	This was the perfect little spot for us. Lee made us feel right at home. The bed was very comfortable!! Lots of places to eat. We did have quite a bit of trouble with parking due to construction. Just make sure you read aaaall the signs along the street and you'll be fine! 
479402	32331492	42141	28756534	Catherine	TrÃ¨s bons Ã©changes avec Lee, appart trÃ¨s agrÃ©able et lumineux, le quartier Pilsen vaut le dÃ©tour (typique populaire et de bons restaurants) nous avons adorÃ© notre sÃ©jour ! 
479402	32829352	42146	4283174	Cris	Tout Ã©tait parfait. L'appartement est trÃ¨s agrÃ©able. Les photos sont trÃ¨s fidÃ¨les. Les check-in et check-out ont Ã©tÃ© trÃ¨s faciles. Je recommande cet appartement sans rÃ©serve.
479402	33660000	42155	28254340	æ­¡	It's a good house. We feel warm and comfortable here. It's also near the train and bus so it's really convenient to go anywhere. 
479402	34082977	42159	12997579	Daniel	We really enjoyed staying in Lee's lovely home. The apartment is so nice (we all left with big apartment envy) and the location is very convenient for getting into the Loop. We also loved the neighbourhood and actually ended up spending most of our time exploring locally. We didn't meet Lee, but she was a great host and communication was very smooth. Would definitely recommend staying here.
479402	34436632	42163	31991577	Richard	A great place to stay away from downtown Chicago. Parking was great. Most times we parked right in front of the building. Taking the the train was was easy and as long as you familiarize yourself with the train routes you can get most anywhere without driving or a cab. The pink line was right around the corner. The place was clean, quiet and had everything we needed. Thanks, Lee!
479402	34833597	42167	7593905	Manmeet	As the name says, it is a beautiful house with a lot of comfortable and cozy places to sit/relax. Lee was super quick in responding, and took good care of the apartment being given in a neat condition. She made sure that we had all the amenities and was readily available on phone. We got late in check-out, but she was sweet to let us take our time.  The apartment is close to the 'tourist-places' if you have car. It had all the things we could possibly use/need. Lot of Mexican food places on the street. Parking was convenient; we parked right outside the door.  If you visit Chicago - do stay here. Best for the price you pay.
479402	35080242	42170	30654198	Tyler	I had an awesome stay at this apartment! It was perfect for my trip to Chicago! The apartment has a lot of charm and the location was perfect for me. The apartment was also very clean and comfortable. Lee is very helpful and communicating with her was very easy. I would definitely stay here again.
479402	35665455	42176	28017461	Karen	We spent 7 days in Lee's apartment, it's really a very cozy lovely place. Perfect for three girls, Lee allows you to feel at home.The nieghborhood is not a fancy one, but it's very safe and quiet, very well located you can access everywhere from there by bus or subway.
479402	36271768	42182	30877426	Jacques	MalgrÃ© une entrÃ©e vÃ©tuste, l'appartement de Lee correspondait Ã  nos attentes malgrÃ©. On s'y sentait chez soi dans un amÃ©nagement agrÃ©able et confortable.
479402	36983530	42188	35434187	Thomas	Although I didn't get to meet Lee in person, she was a very responsive host and promptly answered any questions that I had. The place had a cozy and eclectic feel and the neighbourhood was quiet. Definitely highly recommended if you don't mind being a little outside downtown.  
479402	37296425	42191	30315431	Danyale	It was a fantastic first airbnb experience.  The apartment was adorable and had everything we needed.  It was nice to explore another city and be able to feel at home! She gave complete information on anything we would need and responded promptly to all other questions.  She was a superb hostess!!  
479402	38151975	42198	35425510	Ana	Lee's apartment was just what we needed! In addition to the wonderful location with access to shops, restaurants, and a grocery store, her place is cozy yet spacious and incredibly welcoming! We couldn't have asked for a better place in a better location. We're definitely keeping her at the top of our list for our next visit!
479402	38514850	42201	35414192	IÃ±igo	At the arrival, our first thought was that the state of the apartment didn't exactly correspond with the pictures of the cozy apartment on the website. It looked old, dusty and a little ramshackle. But actually, that was not the problem. There were roaches. We saw a lot at night, in the kitchen and in the bathroom, so we had to leave inmediately. It was a pity because the neighbourhood is nice and Lee had been very kind to us, but we think that  the house was obviously not in conditions to be rented. Nevertheless, Airbinb was totally efficient solving our problem and Lee was very comprehensive and helpful with the refund of the days we didn't stay.
479402	39010663	42205	24880423	Maheshie	My boyfriend and I had an amazing experience in Pilsen. I've always loved the neighborhood and being able to keep at home was a dream. The house was great. On one of the hottest weekends of the summer, the air conditioning worked perfectly. We cooked a lot at the house and all the cutlery we needed was available. The bed was also very comfortable.
479402	40485364	42216	37732612	Donald	We had a outstanding experience and were very happy with the apartment. We had a chance to meet Lee upon arrival and she was great. Very accommodating and helpful with recommendations in the neighborhood. A very clean and comfortable apartment. Nice location and neighborhood with plenty of street parking was a great feature. 
479402	40892726	42219	5126106	Brittany	Lee was a very responsive and generous host. We decided to stay further out for Lollapalooza this year and drive in for the shows. It really was no problem, only a few minutes drive. The place was super cute. It is an older building, but she warns this in her listing. We found it to be vintage and loved it! Parking is also very easy in the area which is a park staying farther away from downtown main area. We had a few hiccups at end of the trip with a leak but cleaned everything up and she agreed to credit us. Overall her communication was awesome and we could stay with her again. 
479402	42381938	42229	31263725	Lia	This was my first trip to Chicago and my first trip all by myself. I did not meet Lee in person, but she was always reachable in case of need. As she said, it is a really old building and the apartment got a vintage touch. Lee was really kind and there for me when I needed something. Actually I should stay two times here, but unfortunately the apartment was not what I expected. Even though she cleaned it before my arrival, there was a lot of dirt and I am not used to live like that. She came directly over to clean again and she is even refunding my second stay. Not a complicated person at all :) Thank you Lee.
479402	43248373	42234	37151162	Michelle	Lee called us to make sure that we found her place. She was always available whenever we had a question and was very easy to communicate with. Close enough to easily uber to downtown. Very cozy apartment.
479402	43700008	42237	41115971	Michael	Lee was a very friendly host, and gave us some great tips for getting around in the city. The apartment was just as she described it, and in a great location right next to the Pink Line. The neighborhood was very quiet but welcoming. All-in-all it was a great value!
479402	44151005	42240	38491060	Katie	Everything about our stay was wonderful!  Lee was an amazing host and always super helpful.  The place was beautiful and the location was great.  The most comfortable place I've stayed at while traveling ever.
479402	46553203	42258	30463974	Dima	Thank you for the staying 
479402	46911347	42261	39384909	Kim	Great first experience using air bnb. The apartment was perfect, clean and cozy. And the location was great! We loved the style and couldn't stop gushing over all of the books and decor. 
479402	47308291	42264	3480212	Isabelle	The apartment is very cosy and quiet and the next subway station is around the corner. It was just perfect for us 4 being 3 days in Chicago :). 
6611071	35728040	42176	6891001	Tute	The location is excellent. The apartment feels a bit old and needs some work, which Jackie is doing it seems like. Also, it was in line with the photos, and the few things that could be taken care of Jackie quickly fixed. She was incredibly welcoming, helpful and present, which made the stay great. I had a good time. Thank you!
6611071	38554998	42201	37698508	Oscar	Although the apartment is a little old, Jackie make it a comfortable place to stay. The location of the apartment is really good. It takes about 5 minutes to walk to the subway station, and 5 minutes to the Gold Coast.Jackie is a really welcoming person. I have a great time staying in this apartment!
6611071	39224345	42206	17242687	Bianca	Awesome host! My mom has never done an air bnb before and Jackie made my mom open to the air bnb world. She was helpful with directions and suggestions of food and things to do. Jackie also always responded to text very quickly. She also was very accommodating in many ways. I highly recommend staying here. The location was awesome, very comfy bed, and soundproof walls! 
6611071	41245403	42221	38303509	Nicole	This listing was a great find! It was in a very safe, clean building. The unit was also located in a great neighborhood conveniently near public transportation. We found the unit to be very conveniently located and were able to walk to many popular attractions. The unit was very clean and well maintained.  The host was very responsive to communications and any needs we had while staying in her unit. We had a wonderful experience and would highly recommend this place!
6611071	47067544	42262	38521557	Alaina	The description of this apartment was completely accurate; small & cozy. I loved the old building and it is in a beautiful neighborhood. Restaurants, bars, shopping, convenience & drug stores were all a short walk away. And it's located right next to a hotel which made it super easy for Ubers and taxis. If I'm ever staying in this area again I would definitely look up this place. 
6611071	48913672	42276	8483128	Natalie	Jackie was a fantastic host. She was very accommodating and attentive to my needs as a guest, arriving herself after I called her to bring an extra key and extra light bulbs when one burned out. The apartment itself is well equipped with anything one might need. The fridge, oven, microwave, and stove make staying here much more appealing than a hotel. The location was just a short walk away to both public transit and a happening part of town. Loved it and would stay again! 
6713438	37096006	42189	10266076	James	A lovely home in a great neighborhood.  We had an amazing experience!  Amanda was extremely pleasant, and made us feel very at home!  My guests were absolutely blown away.
5855595	37465848	42192	32876726	John	Jason and Stella were very quick to make us feel at home and made sure we had what we needed.  They are both very friendly.  The flat is nice.  We felt comfortable and safe.  We learned we were the first to use the flat.  It is quaint and has a quiet little dining area and a porch over the garden where we enjoyed having coffee and eating meals.   The neighborhood is quiet, except for the Fourth of July,  very nice and consists of brick row houses with nice gardens.  Most of the houses have been nicely restored/improved.  It was fun learning a bit of history about the early Ukrainian immigrants that established the neighborhood.  Public transportation into town is a 15 - 20 minute walk away  and a nice walk.  Lots of good eateries to explore nearby.The flat is a great place for a couple.  When the polishing work is completed, the flat will be a place you may not want to leave.
5855595	39176054	42206	9426368	Maria	My friend and I had a lovely time at Jason & Stella's apartment. The place was cosy but with all the necessities - including a nice sized kitchen, dishwasher, and even a grill on the back patio which was great! They live in a beautiful neighborhood, and we enjoyed just walking around looking at all the cool houses. The area was peaceful, residential, and very safe, but still within walking distance to everything we needed - bars, restaurants, groceries, coffee, and bus stops. We stopped at the gelato shop they recommended (black dog), and it was incredible! I loved exploring Chicago from this lovely little neighborhood, and Stella and Jason made us feel very at home. Definitely recommend to anyone wanting to experience the non-touristy side of Chicago! 
5855595	41154120	42220	9820799	James	This is a nice apartment in a great area. The check-in and out process was easy with Jason meeting me on arrive to show me around the place and provided some good recommendations of places to try.I had a great time staying here.
5855595	42174627	42227	38765997	Elisabeth	My time in Chicago was short and meeting-filled, but I very much enjoyed staying at Jason's place. It was clean, comfortable, and exactly as advertised. Because my schedule was tight (and I missed my flight in) he was very accommodating of my check-in/check-out needs. He had left a written note with all the info I needed about the apartment and great recommendations for the neighborhoodâ€”which is a pretty awesome one. I appreciate the opportunity to get out of the downtown area and see (and live in) the real Chicago in the few hours I had on my own. Would very much recommend the space to a single or a couple looking to explore the city while living like a native.
5855595	47351264	42265	6373014	Offer	Jason was a great host. He was very nice, generous and helpful with every request. The apartment is located in a beautiful and quiet street in a great neighborhood. Plenty of bars, cafes and restaurants on the main streets surrounding the neighborhood.  Altough a bit small, the apartmemt met all of our needs and has a beautiful outside deck. 
5855595	48932961	42276	371690	Beth	Jason set us up with a list of neighborhood spots, an easy checkin and a breezy, airy apartment. We loved staying in a quiet spot so near to Bucktown and Humboldt Park. Especially loved the openness of the flat with all the windows and the breeze, but someone not used to city noise like us might find it difficult. Great kitchen, comfortable bed, washer/dryer, and perfect little breakfast nook inside and outside. 
7246471	38077612	42197	19237296	Matt	Marty was extremely accommodating! She was very responsive the whole way and even though my plane was delayed, making me later than expected, it was not a problem for her. Her house/room is also extremely nice and has everything one would need for their stay. I would highly recommend staying with Marty, as I would do it again next time I am in Chicago.
7246471	38457443	42200	13734037	Ryan	Marty is the best! Her place is very modern and nice and tidy and she's very accommodating. Would definitely stay here again.
7246471	39578651	42209	39068352	Nicole	Fantastic! Marty is super nice & helpful & she was very welcoming. A+ host, would stay again if I ever go back to Chicago. Also the rug in the bedroom is like, astonishingly soft. 
7246471	42169653	42227	37336327	Sean	First trip to Chicago was a great experience. Enjoyed staying at Marty's home. Gorgeous place, nicely decorated. Great bedroom and bathroom.  I definitely recommend. Not directly in the city (what I wanted) but bus line was a short walk away. Excellent communication with her for the 4 nights I was out there. Thank you, til next time!
7246471	42354899	42228	40535606	Eternity	Unfortunately I didn't get to meet Marty but my best friend who stayed with me did. Marty was very communicative and had an amazing place it was so neat and cute! The bed was sooo comfy. Would stay again. Thanks Marty! 
7246471	43838323	42238	36148098	Guilherme	Marty is the perfect host, she is kindly and makes everything perfect for her guest. the bedroom is exactly as the picture, the bed is super soft, for sure I'll be here again. I'd loved my stay.
7246471	44158013	42240	11932127	Dani	Marty is a super nice host! I stayed for 2 days, her place and the bedroom is super comfortable. If I come back to Chicago, I'll be there again!
7246471	46988858	42261	26711588	Benjamin	Marty was great.  She took her lunch break to check me in early and couldn't have been more gracious.  Room was great, very well decorated and clean as can be.  Also, due to some poor weather I decided to leave a day earlier than expected and Marty was kind enough to offer a refund for the last night, which she wasn't required to do.  Would highly recommend her and her place.  Thanks Marty!!!
7246471	48032623	42269	43797263	William	Marty was an excellent host! She was very accommodating and even let me try some of her home cooking the last night I was there. Her home was immaculate and wonderful to stay in. Would recommend her place to anyone!
5970748	33685540	42155	30050196	Hootan	An awesome place to stay in the heart of Lincoln Park. Josh had everything we needed for our stay in Chicago and was quick to respond and address any changes in our schedule. 
5970748	34162271	42160	31247374	Scott	Had a great experience with Josh and his apartment. Josh was super attentive, friendly, and accommodating. The apartment is very nice, spacious, clean, and great location for commuting to the city as well as a good community experience. Several nice details inside the apartment that helped to make my visit enjoyable. I definitely recommend Josh and his place.
5970748	34564262	42164	8462897	Theodore	Josh was almost instantaneous in his replies to my inquiries. The condo was immaculate with nice touches you'd see in a B&B (i.e., toothbrush kit, deodorant, bottled water, snacks, etc.).Convenient short five-ish block walk to the Diversey CTA station, plenty of dining opportunities within walking distance.I visit Chicago several times a year and hope his condo will be available at that time.Great stay!
5970748	34966935	42169	4226796	Jamie	This was the perfect place for my friends and I to stay. We had 3 total. The bed is very comfortable. They provide nice, clean, soft linens.  The kitchen is well equipped. The condo itself was very clean, quiet, and very spacious.  The parking space was a great perk for my group. The location was very central to everything we did. Uber/ Cab rides were cheap and quick, the train is also close by.  The hosts are very responsive and easy to communicate with. 
5970748	35956796	42178	5074396	Steven	Great stay in a large, relatively quiet one bedroom apartment close to a lot to see and do. Easy communication with the host. Complimentary amenities in the bathroom and kitchen were a nice touch. 
5970748	37304922	42191	29134398	Carly	We couldn't have been happier with our stay! The apartment was exactly what we were expecting, if not better! It had plenty of space, was comfortable, quiet, clean, located in a safe area and was walking distance from a coffee shop, grocery store, restaurants and more. Josh was very flexible with meeting up with us to give us the keys and also gave us a quick tour. Josh even had a very detailed binder of apartment details and restaurant recommendations that came in handy. The apartment included a welcome basket with magazines and candy along with basic bathroom supplies (shampoo, shaving cream, towels) for us to use in case we forgot anything. This apartment was so much better than staying in a hotel and it allowed us to enjoy our first trip to Chicago! Check out was effortless. Absolutely loved everything about this place!
5970748	38217574	42198	8395269	Adam	Josh made us feel right at home. My wife and I stayed for our anniversary and he made us a customized anniversary card and left us a bottle of wine! Very considerate. The apartment was very clean and comfortable, as advertised. Highly recommend staying here!
5970748	38801771	42203	34775048	David	Josh made everything super easy.  Home was very clean and well appointed.  Would definitely stay there again.
5970748	40800412	42218	22304542	David	The apartment is in a great location and comes with a parking space which was key for us. The host was very accommodating regarding our check-in, since we had arrived early. Overall, a great stay
5970748	41863403	42225	34291159	Michael	I love coming to Chicago for business and personal trips!  What made this business trip even better than previous ones was staying at Josh and Lisa's condo!!  It was a 3 min walk from where our conference was, plenty of restaurants nearby and a Trader Joe's across the street!  All very excellent!  Josh and Lisa were very accommodating, even leaving us a great bottle of wine to welcome us!  Very clean and quiet too!!  The parking space in the building's garage was a huge bonus too!!  Thank you!! 
5970748	44081189	42239	40624448	John	This place was great! josh was very friendly and was very flexible to meet me to get setup. The place was clean and in a great neighborhood. 
5970748	47337307	42264	5564252	Christopher	Josh was an excellent host.  This was a last minute booking request, and Josh was extremely helpful and accommodating.Everything was exactly as described.  The unit was clean, very comfortable, and in a great location.I'd definitely stay there again.
5970748	48603969	42274	14856360	Erica	Great stay. Josh met us with the keys and was easy to get in touch with. Apartment is in a very safe location, Lake View neighborhood and 0.3 miles from the L. Apartment was clean and spacious and the bed is super comfortable! Would definitely recommend it :)
6969869	37240871	42190	36712981	Heather And Jordan	Kat was a great hostess. The apt is in a perfect location. She was really helpful and made herself available for any questions. We felt right at home and very comfortable. It was the perfect way to experience the city and what life is like living in Chicago. It was great knowing and feeling the trust she put into us and letting us stay in her home. I would recommend any of my friends and family to stay in Kats home if she would have them which I'm sure she would. She made it seem like we were her friends and availed herself and her place as if it was our own.  Thanks again for the great experience. 
6969869	38427424	42200	8832651	David	Great studio apartment in the heart of Chicago! Could not have asked for a better location, so much to do and see within short waking distance. Apartment is very clean, and furnished with style.  Dealing with Kat is a pleasure, communication was excellent throughout. She goes out of her way to make sure you're comfortable, which was very appreciated.  Only issues was with occasional late night music from upstairs due to the thin floor/ceiling, but they always turned it down with a quick knock to the ceiling. Overall an excellent value vs a hotel in this area, and a great option for your stay in Chicago. Oh, and go eat at the Purple Pig!
6969869	39058049	42205	36738912	Mayra	Kat was a great host! I was running late for my check in due to my flight being delayed but she was very understanding  and didn't have a problem with it. She was easy to communicate with and always offered her help. Her apartment was perfect for my weekend visit! It was so nice and homey. It's also in a great location with restaurants, bars, the rail and The Magnificent Mile within walking distance.
6969869	40617256	42217	5944614	Dorianne	It was a great apartment and great location. The host was very accommodating regarding check-in time!
6969869	44787314	42245	38412792	Lindsey	Kat's apartment is in one of the best neighborhoods for shopping, dining & access to transit. Most of the hotels in this neighborhood would cost nearly 2x what Kat is charging. My husband and I stayed here for a full week so we could never have been able to afford a hotel for that amount of time.  Her note that the apartment is a little loud but the noise didn't bother us since it was mostly just traffic noise during the day.  At night we slept fine and never woke up from noise.  She provided lots of new towels, the sheets seemed brand new. The bed was comfortable.  The apartment gets sunlight on 2 sides so it is quite charming and bright.  She provided coffee and use of her Keurig which saved us $$ as well.  If you do prefer coffeeshop coffee, there is a Starbucks right across the street.  She also provided soda to make us feel even more comfortable.  She was attentive, even following up mid-way through our stay via text to make sure we were comfortable.  We had no issues so we didn't need to contact her but if we had, she would have been available.  She is also very flexible as we had to add on an extra night at the end and she was very accommodating.Other guests should just be aware, that as Kat mentioned, the building is older. The plumbing is a little quirky, the elevator is slow and a little small so we mostly used the stairs except for our luggage.  All of this is a small sacrifice to be able to stay in this neighborhood at a relatively low price.  I would definitely stay again.
6969869	46190829	42255	13379898	Molly	The host canceled this reservation 45 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
6969869	46289903	42256	39673976	Mohammad	A perfect home away from home. The apartment is exactly as described and feels cozy, warm, inviting and is absolutely charming. Located steps away from public transport, restaurants, cafes, shopping, supermarkets and much more in downtown. Kat is the absolute perfect host who goes above and beyond to ensure your stay is great, met me at the place as I arrived, was reachable the entire time if I had any questions and had equipped her beautiful place with everything you'll need to feel right at home. The apartment is comfortable and is the perfect place to spend your time in Chicago and get the downtown city living experience in the best way possible. You'll love coming back after a day out and unwinding in this charming apartment.
6969869	46727408	42260	12351607	Deema	Kat is a wonderful host. Communication was prompt from the get go. She met us at her apartment to show us around and ensure we knew how to locate and use all amenities. Throughout the stay we had complete privacy but Kat was a call/text away. At some point during our stay she reached out by text to make sure we were still comfortable and happy, which I truly appreciated. Her unit was extremely clean, tastefully decorated and equipped with everything we needed. It's located centrally in Chicago with easy assess to trains and buses. I will definitely be recommending this place and staying here again! 
6969869	47472615	42266	28366024	Michelle And Nate	Kat was so great, from start to finish.  I cannot say enough great thing about her and how welcome she makes you feel.  My husband and I arrived early and checked out late, she did not hesitate once about our time schedule.  She is extremely communicative and clearly cares about her guests, she even checked in on us mid way to make sure we were okay!  The apartment is perfect size and walking distance to everything.  I think Kat uses new towels every time :-) and the bed was great.  Thank you so much Kat for the great apartment in a great part of the city.  NOTE:  You are in the city and you will hear the traffic noise at all hours of the day, if this will bother you then stay somewhere else; but it's the city so you will have to stay in the country side for that.  
6969869	48459359	42273	7806661	Ashley	Apartment was exactly as pictured, great location, check in/out was simple. Would recommend to a friend. 
6895813	37415965	42191	35696051	Mark	"Amanda's apartment was wonderful.  Perfectly located 2 blocks from Lake Michigan and Divisidero Street, plus 4 blocks to the subway, which I used daily.  Inside Amanda's apartment, a modern kitchen is at one end of am oversided living room/kitchen area.  The living room has a long cushy couch and great 40"" HD TV.   Very comfortable if U enjoy lounging.  The bedroom has a ""most comfortable"" KING SIZE"" bed.  In addition, you have use of a closet to hang clothes.  Great bathroom facilities.  Loved the shower.  Amanda was great to deal with.  We spoke a few times, texted, communicating with her was most pleasant.  Thanks Amanda.  If you are looking for a great one bedroom on the Gold Coast, here it is."
6895813	37935300	42196	19169924	Detronia	My fiance and I loved visiting Amanda's place. She's a home town girl, living in the windy city. Amazing host. Very welcoming. Home is located 15mins for downtown Chicago which was perfect. I'll visit again
6895813	38794700	42203	15193768	Chris	Very easy stay and communication was timely.
6895813	40793047	42218	24256766	Jeff	Amanda is a fabulous host with an exceptionally charming unit in quite possibly one of the best neighborhoods in the city of Chicago. My family and I were looking to spend a weekend in Chicago, and she was more than willing to accommodate us. She is very thoughtful, genuine, and a great communicator. This was my family's first Airbnb experience, and they candidly remarked on the coziness and comfort of the unit and the superb location; in other words, they were very happy! If you're looking to experience all the amazing things that Chicago has to offer, Amanda's unit is in a perfect neighborhood in proximity to all the sights and wonders of the city. As another fellow Airbnb host myself, I truly appreciated her attention to detail in her hospitality. For that, she certainly has my highest recommendation, and I would not hesitate to jump at an opportunity to stay in her unit again in the future.
6895813	44040203	42239	41432359	Louis	Amanda was very nice and helpful. She was quick to reply and answer questions. Her apartment was spacious and clean, and it was in a great part of town- walking distance from the lake, shopping and food. The area her apartment is located is beautiful, and the parking pass she gave us made parking easy and stress-free. Would definitely recommend!
6895813	44964357	42246	40642564	Meghan	We enjoyed our stay in Chicago - great location, spacious, clean, and comfortable. Amanda was very welcoming,  accommodating, and easy to coordinate with.
6895813	45848430	42253	24363898	Bee	Amanda was very easy to communicate with and her space was lovely. Very comfy bed and tons of space in her clean apartment.
6895813	46073083	42254	42783728	Richard	Amanda was awesome to work with very quick to answer and the place was awesome and very homie. Would definitely do business with her again.
509972	1569248	41086	2148075	Christopher	My parents were visiting Chicago and I wanted to find them a place to stay close to where my wife and I  lived.  We came across Sarah's place and thought it looked like it would be comfortable for my parents.  Sarah answered all questions and was prompt with responses.  My parents confirmed that they were very comfortable and really enjoyed talking with Sarah and her husband.  They would definitely stay there again. 
509972	1595415	41090	686000	David	Sarah's place was a perfect fit for us, and she was a fantastic host.Located right in the midst of hip Bucktown, with great proximity to Wicker Park and Logan, we were right in the midst of things. The place was clean, comfortable, and pleasant. As to the hostess and her husband, we couldn't have been happier. We were their first AirBnb guests, but everything was very smooth. They kindly left a bowl of fruit and candy for us on arrival, as well as a guide to nearby bars, restaurants, and coffee shots. Because Chicago was undergoing a serious heat wave and even though it wasn't listed as air conditioned, they even went out and bought an air conditioning unit for the bedroom without even being asked.In short: great location, great space, great hosts. Recommended without reservation.
509972	1623215	41093	285503	Mike & Sabrina	We spent 3 nights at Sarah's and had a great time. They were kind enough to let us check in earlier than the usual time. The private suite is located in a really nice area of Chicago and close to downtown.  
509972	1636440	41095	2591136	Diana	I recently stayed for 2 nights in Sarah's place.  The place was great and perfect for any traveler.  She left out water, snacks, clean towels and toiletries.  The space was decorated very well and was very clean, spacious. There is also apple tv/netflix, wifi and many books to read. She left out travel recommendations for local restaurants, etc. for those who may not be familiar with the area.  The neighborhood itself was very safe, and I couldn't have asked for a more pleasant stay.  Sarah was very professional, courteous and helpful through out this whole process as well. I would definitely stay here again in the future during my many trips to Chicago. 
509972	1697152	41103	26917	Robert	Beautifully kept basement apartment, walking distance from the hippest area in Chicago and about 10 minutes from the metro to take you downtown or to the airport.Sarah and Jeff were perfect hosts. They made some great suggestions on how to see the area and let me know if any events were going on - but equally they gave space and made sure I didn't feel like I was a pain with my questions.I am *so* glad I stayed in the Wicker Park/Bucktown area rather than Downtown. This was the perfect place to live like a local. A particularly trendy, well fed, classily drunk local.Internet connection, Apple TV, air con in the bedroom. Even if you don't leave the apartment you'll be very happy.
509972	1750298	41109	6039017	Nicole	"We stayed at Sarah's place for a quick overnight getaway before leaving out of O'Hare. The apartment was very clean, nicely decorated and was well stocked with bottled water, fruit, and even some chocolates. The bathroom was big and clean and the bedroom had a really comfortable bed. The book selection was pretty amazing. In fact, I debated staying in to read.We loved Bucktown. After visiting The Map Room for a beer we walked to a Cuban restaurant that featured a great Cuban quartet. Afterwards we hopped on the subway and went downtown. The only glitch was that around 10:30 pm most of Sarah's block experienced a ""brown out"" when a transformer blew. We were without electricity (no A/C was tough!) all night. Sarah called us immediately offering candles and whatever else we needed. They even refunded us our money - which was really nice.I recommend staying here if you need simple, cozy, and clean accomodations. Downtown is just a few subway stops away. But you may not feel like leaving Bucktown. We can't wait to return.    "
509972	1788917	41114	2408570	Becka	My mom, sister, and I had such a great weekend visiting Chicago in July, and so much of our enjoyment of the trip revolved around Sarah's charming, well-appointed, and perfectly located studio. It had everything we needed for our stay, including very comfortable sleeping quarters, an extensive library of great books, and apples, bottle water, and chocolates to welcome us upon our arrival! We were so comfortable in the space itself, not to mention the fact that we completely fell in love with the neighborhood and loved strolling around the residential streets, discovering our favorite cafes (Red June, right down the street, has fantastic coffee!) and being in such close proximity to Wicker Park, a neighborhood that offered so much more character than if we had stayed downtown in a nondescript hotel.Though we sadly didn't get the chance to meet Sarah in person, she was a lovely host from afar: she answered all of our questions and always promptly responded to all of our messages, and was very flexible in our check-out time.Thanks Sarah!
509972	1821216	41118	2805399	Stephanie	Our stay with Sarah was great and we would definitely stay again. The basement suite was really comfortable and roomy. There was a welcome package with a suggested restaurants, bars, cafes, and metro stations all mapped out for us. The neighbourhood was perfect, close to the metro and plenty of great restaurants and shops around. Overall, highly recommended :)
509972	1899839	41127	2357144	Carol	We had a wonderful stay at Sarah's Bucktown suite.  The place was as listed, very clean and comfortable.  Sarah was very helpful with directions to shops in the area and left us cold drinks and snacks on arrival!  The location of the suite was well suited to our visit of Chicago and it was great to have a free parking spot.  I would definitely stay here again on future trips to Chicago
509972	1924340	41129	1523483	Matthew	Another shout-out to Sarah and her and her partner's suite. Perfect location if you'd rather be in Bucktown/Wicker Park than the Loop (definitely the case for me), well-appointed, fridge stocked with drinks, fruit, and some chocolate, and a helpful guide to nearby restaurants, shops, etc. (if you're a swimmer there in the summer check out Holstein Pool, just a few blocks away!). And loved having a parking space. Definitely will look to stay here again on my next Chicago trip. 
509972	1967959	41134	458578	Amanda	The space is the garden level of a row house on a quiet street in Bucktown, an up and coming neighborhood in Chicago. The rental has a private entry off the main street and there is free on-street parking in addition to the space Sarah provided behind her house. The living room space has windows that look to the street that let plenty of light in. The couch is comfy and can open up to a sleeper if needed. The bedroom offers a double bed with big comfy pillows. There is an AC unit in the bedroom that can cool off the entire apartment and the windows in the front open for fresh air. There is an apartment-sized refrigerator for drinks and left-overs. The bathroom is small but for a weekend trip, it was comfortable to use. Sarah provides towels, sheets, a hair dryer and shampoo and conditioner. There is a large flat screen TV with Netflix which tempted us to stay in and watch Breaking Bad the entire weekend but we finally got out and explored the city. The Blue Line is within 10 minutes and there is a cute breakfast place called Red June at the corner of the street that I highly recommend. My fiancÃ© and I had a wonderful experience with Sarah's rental and we would stay here again!
509972	2080787	41145	2793852	Claudia	"I just stayed 6 days in the apartment and it was my first airbnb experience. I loved the apartment and as well the neighborhood. The appartment was very clean, comfortable and equipped with everything you need and as a plus a nice TV with netflix and also a book collection. Sarah even left cold drinks and fruits/chocolate in the mini fridge. She even brought a mini heater down when it got ""colder"" for one night to ensure i wasnt cold when sleeping.There is so much to explore around the appartment: unique restaurants, cafes (check out Red June Cafe on the corner street or Irazu Costa Rican Restaurant). Another advantage was the short walk to the subway which takes you downtown or to Ohare fast. I always used the subway to go to my favorite Beach ""Loyola"" which takes a bit (45 min with subway) but a wonderful beach which is so peaceful and not crowded at all. Overall i would highly recommend Sarahs place and if i get the chance i will definetely come back! Thanks again for being great hosts, the apartment definetely beats every hotel experience."
509972	2112885	41148	3107809	Lauren	This is a great little suite! A home away from home in an awesome, trendy little neighbourhood in Chicago. We really enjoyed our stay - Sarah made us feel very welcome and was available for help if we needed. i would definitely recommend staying here! 
509972	2141597	41151	2468375	Mandalyn	Sarah's lower-level apartment was the perfect place for our short stay in Chicago.  The space is comfortable and clean, and Sarah and her husband were excellent hosts.  Downtown is a 20-minute walk/train ride away from the quieter Bucktown/Wicker Park neighborhood.  Excellent experience for booking our first Airbnb!
509972	2191771	41156	2808251	Sarah Jane	We stayed at Sarah and Jeff's Wicker Park/Bucktown private suite and couldn't have asked for a nicer time.  Their apartment was incredibly comfortable and clean and located in a great part of Chicago with plenty of terrific restaurants, bars, and shops all within walking distance. It is also very close to transportation links to the downtown/Loop area and O'hare. Sarah and Jeff definitely went above and beyond to make sure we enjoyed our stay, by leaving maps, suggested walking tours, and suggestions for great places to try out near their apartment. They even stalked the fridge with water and some snacks, and have a terrific book collection to peruse during any downtime. Sarah made herself available for any questions/problems but also made it very easy to come and go as we pleased. If/when we come back to Chicago, we'd stay with Sarah and Jeff in a second. 
509972	2246424	41162	1880965	Molly	We came to Chicago for the weekend for the Renegade Show in Wiker Park.   Sarah's place was perfect for us!  She and the place were amazing!  Great location, fruit and drinks in the fridge, and a really comfy bed!  Thanks again for everything!  See you next year!!
509972	2277310	41166	3106915	Kiri	Cute place, great neighborhood!  Friendly and flexible hosts.
509972	2301463	41169	2205379	Alexis	Sarah was very accommodating to our schedules and communicative on all aspects of our stay in advance. The suite was very clean, comfortable, and had very helpful print-outs on places to eat in the neighborhood, as well as a mini-fridge stocked with fruits, sodas, and water. Sarah also gave me advice on traffic, possibly saving me hours stuck in car for no reason. The location was great and very convenient for us. I would highly recommend staying here, thanks so much, Sarah!
509972	2343819	41171	2428066	Misha	Sarah and Jeff had a lovely space for us in a trendy neighborhood just outside of Chicago. It was so convenient and comfortable! They went above and beyond our expectations to make sure we had a great stay. I loved the little details like how Sarah selected some delicious beers from a local brewery and put them in the fridge for us. Also, they had maps and guidebooks to borrow which made our visit so much fun and so easy. I know where we're staying the next time we visit Chicago!
509972	2369155	41174	916600	Gary	Sarah was great.  Excellent location. Very clean. Maps to local hot spots.  Goodies in the fridge, and even wine glasses!  We will try to stay here again the next time we're in Chicago.
509972	2502165	41186	2839932	Charlie	I couldn't have had a better experience than my stay in Sarah's location. Everything was as pictured. Plenty of well-appointed space, lots of amenities, and the ideal host who was always available to answer any questions. The neighborhood is a gem and adds to the experience of being in Chicago. I wouldn't think of staying anywhere else when I return to the city by the lake.
509972	2678375	41204	3074893	Cara	We had a great stay with Sarah while we were visiting Chicago. Sarah was very flexible and always replied to emails and communications promptly. Upon our arrival, there were snacks and drinks available in the fridge, which was a very nice touch. We did not meet in person, but Sarah was a great host overall. I would not hesitate to recommend this space to others.
509972	2714320	41207	3468026	Stella	"We loved our stay at ""Sarah""s place!.  It is in a lovely area of older well kept homes.  We felt safe on all of our walks looking at the wonderful little shops and the train station is very close.  Sarah left lots of maps and restaurant information for reference.The Red June is a must for coffee/tea and they have a nice selection of breakfast and lunch items that were fresh and tasty (and only half a block away).  The suite was clean and the mini frig well stocked.  The fresh fruit and chocolates were our favorite!  We will definitely stay here next time we are in Chicago."
509972	2785678	41215	3687477	Monika & William	Sarah was a perfect host for our stay in Chicago. Her apartment is well located, nicely furnished and very clean. Sarah was great to deal with in organising the stay, flexible about arrival and departure  times and made sure we had privacy and space during our stay. After four days we really felt like it was our home and were sad to leave - would definitely stay again! Thanks!
509972	2810431	41218	3712476	Kapellmeister	Sarah's suite was a cozy home a way from home, and  tucked in a great area. Like everyone said, she left out some fruit, chocolate, water, and a few other beverages to make you feel right at home!10 minute walk to the metro, 10 minute ride to the loop, and 25 minutes from Ohare. Wicker park is an eclectic neighborhood, so I actually just hung out in the area, shopped, explored, and ate well (there's a number of great vegan restaurants).I travel to Chicago often, and I know exactly where I'm staying the next time I come back! 
509972	2872495	41225	4084026	Kata	Sarah and Jeff's place was great!  Absolutely true to the description and photos on their profile page.  Very comfortable and cozy if you want to hunker down for a few days, and also in a great location near trains if you want to park backpacks and adventure around town.  Sarah and Jeff had amazingly soft towels and sheets, left chocolates and almonds, had bottles of water chilled ready for us, and even left a few brews in the fridge.  Sarah was my point of contact and was very flexible, helpful, all while being a hands off type of hostess.  I would absolutely stay there again, and recommend it with great enthusiasm.  Great materials in the house for getting around, maps, etc.  Wonderful stay, thank you so much!
509972	2905144	41231	2526190	Chloe	What an amazing Airbnb experience. You NEED to stay with Sarah and Jeff in Chicago. These guys wrote the book on how to be amazing hosts!The. Greatest. Hosts. EVER!!The place is super spacious and private. Sarah and Jeff will give you all the space you need but If you're wanting to make new friends, they will happily hang out with you which we loved! We instantly became terrific friends and they were kind enough to invite us to a house party. All of us went out for dinner to one of their favourite taco joints in Wicker Park which was amazing.The suite is SO cozy to escape the chilly temps of Chicago - we arrived on an extremely frosty day and Sarah was sweet enough to lend us a bag of warm clothes to wear between arriving and shopping for our own. (Stupidly we weren't overly prepared for just how cold it was).It is immaculately clean, the bed is super comfy, they even leave you drinks and snacks as well as toiletries. Don't even get us started on Netflix. Sarah and Jeff even let us use their laundry to do washing instead of going to a laundromat around the corner.It is conveniently located in a cool/hip area, just up the road from public transport, in a super safe area and postcard like area. The street looks like it's straight out of a movie.Safe to say we aboslutely loved our time in Chicago and we were very sad to leave. We want to go back there already.What a remarkable city. Go Bulls!
509972	2940900	41235	3881239	Sean	Warm, clean, comfortable and convenient. Sarah and Jeff were great hosts, and I would definitely stay again. They even left snacks, drinks, and fresh bananas for us!
509972	2991876	41242	344618	Kim	"Sarah and Jeff's studio is adorable and very cozy! Nice and warm in the winter when I was there. A lovely place to come ""home"" to. Sarah was very flexible and easy to communicate with.Great location in a quaint residential area with many cafe's, restaurants, and shops nearby. Easy few minute walk to the train that runs directly to downtown and O'hare airport."
509972	3019622	41246	4202823	Lucille	I'm a former Chicago resident, so I knew that this was absolutely the area in which I wanted to stay; Wicker Park and Bucktown are FULL of great places to eat (including a fantastic coffee shop a stone's throw away from the apartment), interesting stores, great people watching, etc. The place is also close enough to the Blue line Western stop to make getting downtown and to the airport extremely convenient. The accommodations themselves were exactly what I needed: quiet, private entrance, private bath, room to spread out, plenty of linens, books, Netflix, and a small fridge with a few beverages and snacks. Perfect. If/When I go back to Chicago, I'll be checking here first. Sarah was a great host!
509972	3060916	41254	3922466	Kris	This place was absolutely perfect for my weekend in Chicago.  I purchased a 3 day CTA pass at the airport and took the blue line most places.  There was a wonderful coffee place on Armitage called Ipsento where I had a Cardamom Rose latte with almond milk every morning and a delicious sandwich one day for brunch.  The walk down to the main Wicker Park intersection wasn't too far either.The apartment was exactly what I wanted.  Wood floors, doors and trim.  Lots of books, wifi, tv/movies.  Fluffy soft towels.  Chocolates and fruit.  Sarah & Jeff were gracious hosts.  1 thing I will mention.  It did not bother me, but it's good to know - these are old houses with wood floors.  That means you will hear those above you walking around, you will probably hear their voices (though not well enough to hear the words).  They were not up crazy early or late, but if this is the kind of thing that bothers you, you should go to a hotel.  Personally, it made it more like home for me.In summary, I highly recommend this apartment.
509972	3097093	41259	2243722	Stephen	Everything was wonderful. Sarah and Jeff's place was nice, clean and perfect for exploring the city. They were also extremely helpful with any questions one might have. I'd highly recommend a stay there. 
509972	3127299	41264	2571828	Courtney	Sarah and Jeff's place was in a fantastic location. We loved going to the many cafes and restaurants that were close-by. The train was a short 5-10 minute walk away. Sarah and Jeff are very kind, helpful and easygoing hosts, nothing ever feels like too much trouble. I would highly recommend  a stay at Sarah and Jeff's place, it was clean and comfortable and everything we needed during our travels to Chicago! 
509972	3482248	41310	4671238	Stephanie	Thank you Sarah & Jeff! The place was so sweet and cozy and clean. Had a great stay. :)
509972	3514563	41316	3291250	Caroline	Great place to visit Chicago for a first time ! Our hosts were very nice and helpfull > lots of little attentions in the appartment, very cosy place to stay at especially in winter ! Close to the metro and the Damen/Wicker Park activity. It was great to have such nice hosts since we didn't know the city.And if you like books, you'll enjoy Sarah and Jeff's private library :)You can reserve your 'eyes closed' as we say in France !
509972	3566076	41323	347723	Sabrina	This appartment is great and well located. It had all the necessary commodities for an intimate stay. Sarah and Jeff were very  helpful and easy to communicate with. We've had a wonderful stay. We highly recommend it! 
509972	3629174	41331	347799	Kate	We loved this apartment so much! It's very cozy and warm, even in the Chicago winter, and was the perfect size for the two of us. All the books are a nice touch, as were the snacks left by our very friendly hosts. Very comfortable and conveniently located.  Would definitely return on a future trip!
509972	3667752	41335	4358275	Stephen	It was my first time to Chicago and it couldn't had been a better experience or location to stay. The house is in a very nice neighbourhood and only a short walk away from the train station. In the lead up to staying Sarah's communication was fantastic and the directions she provided made finding the location very easy. The apartment was very clean and it had everything myself and my friend needed. She even had a list of brunch/restaurant recommendations printed which was a lovely thought to help us out in the local area. Plenty of movies or tv shows to watch on Netflix too. Would definitely stay again.
509972	3710495	41339	4326674	Brette	Sarah and Jeff were wonderful hosts! They are very well well-organized and had directions and recommendations ready. We took full advantage of the walking tour cards they had. The apartment is clean, quiet, and comfortable and is just a quick walk to the blue line if you want to head downtown but Wicker Park has a lot to offer for a couple of days. The place and the hosts come highly recommended. The best of airbnb!
509972	3771400	41346	4579941	Jo-Anne	I had a great stay in Wicker Park in this apartment. It was like my home away from home and I thoroughly enjoyed my time. Sarah and Jeff were really friendly and I was impressed by all the helpful information and amenities they had put together in the room for her guests. The apartment was close to public transport and all the awesome shops and restaurants, but far away enough that it was still peaceful and quiet. I would definitely stay again. High fives!
509972	3876442	41357	97623	Connie	Sarah and Jeff's suite was exactly what we were looking for to get to know the Wicker Park/Bucktown neighborhood.  The suite is within walking distance to great restaurants and convenient to the blue line and major north/south bus lines.  Sarah's recommendations, maps and walking tours came in handy since we hadn't done our usual research before coming to Chicago for a few days.  The suite was comfortable and had everything we needed for a short stay.  We appreciated cold drinks and water in the small fridge.  We would have spent more time looking over their excellant library if we'd had more time.  Wireless was excellant.  We didn't use the television.  A desginated parking spot behind the house really sealed the deal for us. 
509972	3919072	41360	3344195	Mendy	This apartment was very clean, stocked with great books to take off the shelf to read, a TV with access to Netflix for free, bottled water and snacks, a really comfortable bed, and an awesome shower. The place is adorable, and you even get your own parking space. The neighborhood is lovely, with many coffee shops, restaurants, and bars to easily walk to. The hosts were very nice, and made sure that we had everything we needed. I can't recommend this place enough, if you are traveling through Chicago, and want to experience one of the great Chicago neighborhoods!
509972	3973432	41365	2044255	Danica	We loved staying at Sarah and Jeff's! Great part of town, very easy to find transportation to anywhere and back again. Huge selection of amazing books. Sarah was extremely helpful in locating really great Gluten-Free restaurant options to accommodate me, and there are great resources for things to do and see all over the city! Thanks for a very welcoming stay! Looking forward to our next visit!
509972	4040080	41369	3722348	Jessica	We had an amazing time at Sarah and Jeff's!  Sarah was fantastic to deal with prior to our stay and even though it was our first time using Air BnB she made the process extremely easy.  Sarah and Jeff's is in a really great part of town and the list of restaurants and things to do (left by Sarah in the apartment) both in the neighbourhood and Chicago were great - we tried Sarah's recommendation of Cumin, the Indian/Pakistani restaurant in the neighbourhood and it was awesome.  The apartment was really warm and toasty and has everything you could want (even down to welcome drinks and snacks on arrival), it was  also great having the TV so you could have a chilled out night at 'home' when it was freezing outside.  Thanks Sarah and Jeff for such a lovely stay, if you ever visit NZ make sure you look us up!
509972	4144354	41378	1863731	Sjoerdje	Me and my boyfriend had a great stay at Sarah and Jeff's. The space you rent is very comfortable, private and clean. Public transportation (to The Loop) is nearby, but we also really enjoyed Wicker Park/Bucktown.The house is located on a mainly residential street (which means a good night's sleep) but in close proximity to many shops, cafes and restaurants. I would definitively recommend staying here, and would to come back some time. 
509972	4211013	41383	4633900	Luke	This place is very clean, warm and comfortable. Jeff and Sarah were extremely accommodating and the little extras in the flat when we arrived, info about Chicago and area, chilled water. Was a pleasure to stay.
509972	4242911	41386	4588133	Melissa	The Wicker Park/Buctown Private Suite was exactly as listed :)  A cozy haven from the freezing Chicago wind and rain.  Very easy to access via public transport and set up very professionally (including walking tour cards and maps!).  My boyfriend and I were particular fans of the towels.  And the Belly Shack - which was very close!  I highly recommend it for staying in Chicago.
509972	4321140	41392	4635601	Lauren	I really loved staying at Sarah & Jeffs private suite.I arrived on a cold Chicago day and the suite was warm and inviting, Sarah was lovely and very welcoming - she made sure I had everything I needed to feel right at home and was always quick to respond to any queries that I had both before and throughout my stay. Highly recommended. Thank you Sarah & Jeff!
509972	4373792	41395	1750940	Elaina	Sarah and Jeff are wonderful hosts! They are super friendly and very hospitable. They provided all the necessary amenities and even had some snacks for us!  Water, granola bars, oranges and bananas.  The private suite was so spacious and clean!  The bed was super comfortable, too.  We took advantage of the Netflix and caught up on some shows! We loved how close the buses and CTA were.  To and from Oâ€™Hare Airport is super fast and convenient. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I would recommend all my friends and family to stay here! If youâ€™re ever in Chicago, STAY HERE!!! You wonâ€™t regret it!!  =)
509972	4470221	41401	1175354	RÃ©nald	I stayed five nights at this place and it was awesome. Sarah and Jeff are great hosts. I'm already planning my next trip in Chicago and no doubt I'll return to this apartment.
509972	4543273	41406	4762362	Mick	Great location. Lovely roomNice to have NetflixWelcoming hosts who left good contact details and information 
509972	4699612	41415	3461530	Scott	Great place in a great location along with great hosts. Sarah and Jeff had clear communication throughout the entire process and offered help of any kind if we needed it and even accomodated our late checkout. Plenty of resources at the place to get around town, go out to eat, or just stay in to relax. The neighborhood was fun and safe as well as the place being clean and well kept. Had a chance to talk to Sarah and Jeff at times and they made you really feel welcome in the windy city with their friendly, personable vibe. Will definitely be back sometime.
509972	4863389	41423	6122853	Carl	Our stay at Sarah and Jeff's was exactly as advertised.  Clean, cozy garden apartment.  I think you've figured that out if you've been reading the rest of these reviews...but in fact, they are not lying.  It's a great place to stay if you're in Chicago.
509972	4961592	41429	948175	Mike	I had a great experience staying here. Everything was as advertised and Sarah communicated very well throughout the process. Awesome location. Thanks for everything!
509972	5047587	41435	3078045	Jason	Clean place close to bars/restos in the Bucktown/Wicker Park area. On a quiet street and place is cute. Sarah was very helpful with an early check in for us. The water/drinks in the fridge and snacks were  a nice touch and Sarah was always quick to respond when I had any questions. The netflix/Apple Tv was also a nice touch.
509972	5158500	41441	3325146	Corinne	Nice stay in Wicker Park at this place. Looks exactly like the photos. It was very clean and well-organized. Having Netflix was a great plus as well.Lots of restaurants and shopping within a short walk down North Avenue to a very popular part of town. 
509972	5257098	41446	28569	Robert	"Sarah and Jeff's place is warm and inviting - very easy to feel at home.  Coming from Los Angeles we wanted to be ""car free"" and enjoy the real urban experience...mass transportation and all.  Sarah and Jeff's place is an easy 10 minute walk from the blue line which links downtown and O'hare, so coming and goind was quick and simple  - 15 minutes to downtown and roughly a half hour to the airport.  The neighborhood feels safe with beautiful row houses on tree lined streets...highly recommended."
509972	5306778	41449	3324027	Jennifer	Sarah & Jeff were gracious hosts and I would come back and stay at their place next time I visit Chicago! The location was very central, easy access to public transit, and the overall apartment was cute & cozy. Thanks for a great stay!
509972	5482209	41457	4947661	Michelle	Sarah and Jeff's place was great!  The apartment was perfect for us and there was even a mini fridge stocked with drinks!  Sarah was really available even though we never actually met, she touched base to make sure we got in OK and had everything we needed.  The neighbourhood was great and really close to the L Train to get downtown or to O'Hare.  We could have spent an entire day exploring Wicker Park alone, there were so many nice restaurants and shops.  I would definitely recommend!
509972	5673125	41466	3538673	Cara	Sarah and Jeff's place was perfect for our stay. They are great hosts and their suite offered everything we needed (AC, full bath, comfy bed and a small place to stash all the food we bought in Chicago) and in a fabulous location. Visiting Chicago and staying in a neighborhood away from downtown really allows you to check out all the great food, stores and parks that Chicago has to offer. The house was one block from a bus stop, about 3 blocks from the blue line and maybe 5 blocks from zipcar. Traveling around the city was really easy. We felt absolutely at home!
509972	5780816	41471	1120546	Larissa	"Sarah and Jeff's place was the perfect spot for our vacation in Chicago! The apartment was cozy and located in a beautiful neighborhood, which we explored for a full day - lots of great places to eat, explore and shop.  Sarah is a great host; although we didn't get a chance to meet in person she checked in throughout our stay to ensure we had everything we needed. The apartment had Netflix and Wifi available, which was a nice addition; directions to the apartment and access to get in were both very easy thanks to Sarah.Both Sarah and Jeff were helpful with providing recommendations and obviously love the city they live in (which is easy to do with all that Chicago has to offer)! Would highly recommend staying in Wicker Park, its close to the ""L"" train and also provide a nice haven from the downtown in the evening. "
509972	5936818	41478	2495160	Jeremy	Small, but quaint place.Neighborhood is safe, friendly.If you're looking for the downtown vibe, this isnt the place for you.Its a cool hipsteresque neighborhood.
509972	6104469	41485	5403343	Julien	Jeff et Sarah sont trÃ¨s attentifs Ã  notre bien-Ãªtre. L'appartement est agrÃ©able, trÃ¨s bien situÃ© pour profiter du quartier (dynamique) et pour accÃ©der au centre ville de Chicago. Nous sommes satisfait de notre sÃ©jour dans ce logement.
509972	6234596	41491	5034107	Louise	Staying with Sarah and Jeff was our first experience of Airbnb and as a result, I'll never use a hotel again!! We arrived in the morning and Sarah had organised being able to get into the apartment early which as such a life saver!! The apartment was bigger than we expected , very nicely furnished and lovely to have or own door to unlock at the end of the day. Sarah and Jeff had provided oodles of info about where to go in Chicago and as a result we discovered a city that we will def return to- Wicker Park as the highlight!!Thank you Sarah and Jeff  
509972	6415798	41498	1700597	Sarah	The apartment is in a great location, within walking distance of many shops and restaurants. Sarah was friendly and responded to messages very quickly. She put together some helpful recommendations for the neighborhood and even left some snacks and drinks in the fridge. The parking spot in the back was also very convenient. We had a great stay.
509972	6653009	41506	4314636	Bradford	Sarah & Jeff's place was absolutely perfect â€“Â close to the CTA (Damen #50 & Armitage #73 buses, or the Blue Line), and situated in the heart of Bucktown. Their place was clean, secure, comfortable and as an added bonus came with a great book collection (Herzog & Poe, just a couple highlights). Sarah is a super quick communicator, responding to email within minutes. If you're in the neighborhood, I highly recommend a stop at the Map Room (Coffee in the morning & a huge craft beer selection in the evening) or the Red June Cafe for breakfast. 
509972	6749535	41510	3943981	Mary Ann & Michael	Sarah and Jeff's place was great. It was clean and comfortable, and the perfect location for us. Great bars and places to eat in the neighborhood!
509972	7034604	41521	1175354	RÃ©nald	This was my second stay in the apartment of Sarah and Jeff. I can not imagine a better place to stay in Chicago. I love the neighborhood, Damen Avenue and its restaurants, bars, cafes and shops. Sarah is simply adorable. I'm not at my last trip to Chicago and, certainly, I will stay here again.
509972	7199008	41527	805085	Doc	We had a great stay at Sarah and Jeff's. The apartment is in a perfect location, close to great restaurants and boutiques. It was pretty easy to find parking spots in the street and walk around to subway. There is no sink, other than the bathroom one so it was not easy to fill up our bottles but the mini fridge was stocked up with cold beverages and fruits!
509972	7485136	41539	8109029	Jenny	Sarah's place was perfect for our stay in Chicago. It was clean and spacious along with great amenities such as netflix, mini fridge and microwave. Sarah provided everything a hotel would such as towels, hair dryer, hamper, clean bed sheets, clothes hangers and even a first aid kit. The bed was also very comfy, not too hard nor soft. Mini fridge was stocked with refreshments and there is even candy for a quick snack. Sarah was in constant communication with me and responded to emails very promptly and friendly. There was a storm and blackout while we were there and Sarah offered us flashlights. The location is super convenient to downtown (prob. 10 min. drive on highway) and close to many busy streets with restaurants and bars. We had a car and parking was relatively easy to find on the street but if you have no car and have to take public transportation the neighborhood seems very safe. The houses there are cute and charming, reminding me of the brownstones in New York. I would def. recommend their suite and will be staying here again the next time I visit. Thanks Sarah!
509972	7664187	41546	6173658	Julien	Logement trÃ¨s sympathique, Ã  5 min de la station Western de la Blue Line! TrÃ¨s propre, bien dÃ©corÃ©, et fonctionnel!Quartier calme avec plein de bonnes petites adresses pour boire un verre ou manger un morceau!
509972	7779783	41549	8856175	John (Chiang)	Staying at Sarah and Jeff's was definitely an added bonus to visiting the city. Both Sarah and Jeff were very accommodating and very responsive to any inquiries we had regarding our travel. The place is very homey and made me feel like I was a local. I loved that they provided my girlfriend and I a list of their favorite spots in the Wicker Park area. We gladly took their suggestions on a couple of the spots. Their place is definitely very close to restaurants and coffee shops. This was a very good first time Airbnb experience for myself and my girlfriend.  
509972	8186155	41567	505045	Niccole	This was a wonderful experience. Sarah is very communicative and a true host! The apartment is in an adorable and safe neighborhood with very easy access to public transportation. We were a lot closer to the Loop than we thought. The apartment is clean, cozy, and we felt like we were home. Also, Sarah goes above and beyond by stocking the mini fridge with drinks and providing snacks (which we fully enjoyed, so thanks Sarah!). She is very thoughtful leaving full bars of soap and a first aid kit handy. Even candles for ambiance. We actually need to break into the first aid kit while we were there for a small injury. She really did think of everything! We'd definitely stay here again!
509972	8403001	41576	3761176	Dylan	Thanks, Sarah, for the wonderful space and all of your helpful communication! The Bucktown location was super convenient--a short walk to the heart of Wicker Park, the Blue Line, and Logan Square. Great beer bars (go to the Map Room!) nearby, too. The apartment was quiet and nicely equipped with an Apple TV for Netflix streaming. All in all, a great experience--thanks! 
509972	8500301	41581	8647022	Evan	Sarah and Jeff's apartment is in the perfect spot. Walking distance to great cafÃ©s/eateries, bars and shops in Bucktown and Wicker Park but out the way down a quiet residential street. A short 15 minute walk (or bus) to the Blue Line that will take you pretty much anywhere in Chicago including the airport.Sarah and Jeff did everything to make our stay as comfortable and smooth as possible. The apartment is comfortable and has all the necessities of home. No need for a kitchen or wasting time cooking with such a huge range of eat in or takeout options on your doorstep. I'd definitely recommend studying here.
509972	8565501	41583	9080635	Sven	Sarah and Jeff's place was just perfect for my Chicago visit. I found the location, on a pleasant residential street, convenient to public transportation (there's a bus stop one block away and the blue line is less than half a mile) as well as to lots of restaurants and shops in Bucktown and Wicker Park. Sarah responded quickly to my few questions, and made my arrival and departure very easy. I found water, soda, fresh fruit, and granola bars waiting for me in the clean and comfortable apartment, along with well-stocked bookshelves and a thoughtful list of some of my hosts' favorite restaurants in the area. I would absolutely recommend this apartment and its owners without reservations and would happily stay here again.
509972	8655998	41589	1571774	Anya	Lovely place. GREAT area and easy to get to everything.  Really felt at home and cozy here.  Sarah and Jeff were great hosts
509972	8812623	41597	2504899	Benjamin	Felt right at home. Sarah and Jeff were great in keeping in touch during my stay to ensure all was going well.  The basket of things to do and cheat list were so helpful.  The bed was so comfortable I made an effort to stay in it...and partly because of the severe weather blowing through. Also there were many places within walking distance that there was no need for a kitchen. The small fridge and microwave were sufficient. Thanks again!!
509972	8925220	41604	6098643	Summer	I stayed here for 5 nights, and it was a great experience. The apartment is very cozy, clean and well-organized. The hosts have though of everything, and are very accessible and responsive to messages. The surrounding neighborhood is quiet and safe, a classic Chicago neighborhood. I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future. 
509972	9038557	41610	9939396	Blake	Great place to stay in a cool neighborhood.   Very clean and the snacks/water were a nice touch.  The bed was very comfortable and the WiFi was excellent.    Despite being in a very popular neighborhood, parking was very easy. Most days I got a street spot right in front.   Sarah was my main point of contact and was very responsive in our communications.
509972	9091970	41614	3050038	Brenda Joey	My stay at Sarah and Jeff's was exceptional.  Sarah and Jeff were very professional and responsive to my inquiries.  They made access to the apartment easy.  The rental was very clean, organized and had everything I needed.  The area has some of the best restaurants, boutiques and access to public transportation of any neighborhood in Chicago.  Easy street parking (no permit required}.  I would highly recommend this property. 
509972	9203565	41621	10030600	Kia	It was everything I needed. Sarah and Jeff followed up while I was there to make sure I was comfortable. It has snowed the day before I arrived and they had cleared the steps and turned the outside light on , which really helped. 
509972	9323315	41629	2309124	Katherine	Beautiful and well kept home! I came here to get some studying done for finals and it was just what I hoped for! The treats were excellent, the bed was comfortable, and The book collection provided a few nice distractions from my studies! As a first time airbnb user I was nothing but impressed! 
509972	9706864	41645	9906922	Charo	My stay at Sarah and Jeff's was perfect! We stayed there for 7 nights and it was a great experience. The apartment was clean and it really felt at home. It has everything you need as the hosts have thought of everything: the basket of things to do, drinks and snacks, first aid kit and of course, Netflix and Wifi available.Both Sarah and Jeff were really available and communicated very well throughout the process.Awesome location with easy access to public transit.I would absolutely recommend this apartment and its owners without reservations. I would not hesitate to stay here again in the future.Thank you for everything!
509972	9820384	41651	6634097	Peter	A really wonderful place to stay. Sarah and Jeff are extremely considerate, welcoming, and kind. And their apartment is everything you could hope for. 
509972	9870976	41654	1840093	Shane	Sarah & Jeff's place is the perfect place to stay if you're traveling to Chicago for a short time. No kitchen, but who needs it when there's plenty of great restaurants nearby? It's close to the blue line, which is great if you're coming from O'Hare. The place was warm, cozy, and had everything I needed. Highly recommended.
509972	10012020	41664	9687760	Aarti	Sarah & Jeff's place was fantastic for any traveler who wants the Chicago experience - the location was fantastic for getting around and the space felt like having your own hotel suite.  It was a bright, warm (important during a Chicago winter) space with a super comfy bed. Would highly recommend.
509972	10085909	41668	11112558	Vasanth	"I had an excellent stay here!  My visit was on a cold and windy January weekend and I really appreciated how cozy and homely it was inside. I had to work remotely one of the days, and I was able to Skype and chat with my colleagues without a problem. The neighborhood was great to walk through, and the guidebook that Sarah and Jeff put together was helpful in finding places to eat and where to roam around. There were also street guides and maps and walking tour cards -- everything that one would need to explore a new city.  The bed was very comfortable. I did most of my work at the desk in the bedroom. There was also a couch in the living room, where I ate fresh bread from Olivia's Market (a great place to find walking through the neighborhood) with tzatziki dip while watching TV. There were also many many interesting books in the living room bookshelves -- I started reading a travel book on Peru and am planning on getting a trip down there!Sarah and Jeff were super responsive and answered all my questions leading up to and during my visit. I enjoyed communicating with them, and were able to give me information that one wouldn't be able to get from a book, like ""Would it be safe to walk along X street after the improv show is over?""The next time I am in Chicago this will be the first place I will check for a place to stay!"
509972	10161034	41673	358270	Hyden	The place was perfect for me. Really good hosts. I lost the keys in the snow and they got me a spare key in minutes. I would definitely stay again. 
509972	10302281	41681	11802265	Tim	Sarah was great and very quick at responding as well as completely hospitable and extremely flexible.  I would definitely stay there again.  Thanks for all your help, Sarah!
509972	10424426	41688	161031	J Maureen	Sarah was a great host! Easy to communicate with and quick to reply. The suite is cute, clean and well-stocked with books. The bed is super comfortable, the shower is hot and the flatscreen tv is great for checking out Netflix after a day of sightseeing. If you're traveling by car, street parking in the neighborhood is plentiful. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend you stay at Sarah and Jeff's!
509972	10570741	41695	289115	Michael	"Thank you for hosting!Location: Walking distance to the L and a safe neighborhood. 10 minute walk and 30 minute train ride to the airport. It is one of the ""best locations"" in Chicago, just as advertised.Abode: Very clean and comfortable. Tastefully decorated. I was welcomed with a bowl of snacks and cold water in the fridge; very much appreciated. Thanks to Netflix, I watched a lot of law and order while eating take-out Depression Dogs. Turns out I like Law and Order.Hosts: Attentive, courteous, and classy.Check-in/out: The hosts have it figured out. Late night check-in and early morning check-out was painless."
509972	10627167	41698	12405308	Daniel	Sarah and Jeff's spot is terrific. They had snacks and bottled water and were very accommodating. Great hosts!
509972	10717861	41702	11303872	Melissa	Sarah and Jeff were great hosts. Very clear on directions and helpful. The place was great, and the snacks were delightful. However, the couch was insanely uncomfortable and very worse for wear. The springs were jabbyy and uneven. We didn't spend much time indoors or on the couch but do not plan on using it for more than putting your shoes on. We did all our reading and relaxing in the bedroom instead.We would stay there again, I just mention the couch if you are planning on using it.
509972	10843971	41708	9548256	Matt	We had a great time staying at Sarah & Jeff's place. The apartment is a good size for two people with plenty of storage space, the bed is comfortable, it's warm enough even in the winter and the shower is good too :). We were having some problems figuring out who to work the TV and Sarah & Jeff were brilliant in coming over to sort it out as soon as they could. The location is fantastic too. Sarah & Jeff left us a really helpful list of their favourite restaurants, cafes etc. which we consulted often and which never let us down. There were a lot of great places to go nearby, especially on Damen, but the apartment is also 10 minutes from the L which takes you downtown or to O'Hare. There are useful buses even closer to the apartment as well - we used one to go to the United Center for a Bulls game and another to go to Lincoln Park and Second City. Even after the buses and the L have stopped, it's a short taxi ride away from most of Chicago's nightlife.Sarah & Jeff were great at communicating with us throughout and were kind enough to let us check out late, which allowed us to relax and make the most of our last day.I would highly recommend staying here and will definitely try and do so if I'm back in Chicago again!
509972	10982825	41714	11914929	Sajen	Sarah and Jeff's place was awesome! Very quiet, comfortable bed, spacious, and very accessible to the blue line and buses. The convenience of getting in and out as I pleased and quick communication with Sarah was great. This was a wonderful place to stay for my first big visit to Chi town. 
509972	11355375	41729	12274679	Julie	Sarah and Jeffâ€™s place was a wonderful place to stay at.  My friends and I enjoyed our stay at their warm, cozy, and charming place. The apt was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. Sarah gave clear directions and was very accommodating. I loved how they had such a great collection of books.  Itâ€™s about 7-10 min walk to the blue line and takes about 20-30 mins from ohare airpot w/o any transfers. The area is in a quiet residential area and walking distances to good restaurants. Would highly recommend staying here. Thanks sarah and jeff!
509972	19064411	41888	4932653	Ann-Christine	We had a pleasant stay at Sarah and Jeffs house. The apartment is exactly as described. We had everything we needed and Sarah was very fast in responding all our questions. The apartment is perfectly situated in a nice neighborhood and close to the blue line which goes to the airport. Wicker Park/ Bucktown offers loads of nice shops, pubs etc. Perfect place to stay if you want to be located central in Chicago and have your own space and privacy.
509972	19884657	41902	3299151	Jared	Great spot--really cozy, perfect location in Bucktown, great hosts. Highly recommended! 
509972	20509946	41912	19005093	Emma	Sarah and Jeff were wonderful hosts. Sarah was very responsive and helpful to all my inquiries as a first time user of Air BnB and as a first time visitor to Chicago. The space was clean and cozy, and there were even snacks waiting for us! Perfectly located for discovering downtown Chicago - and a double bonus was the wonderful coffee shop a block away en route to the metro. 
509972	21285344	41926	1918497	Eric	Had a fantastic time staying at Sarah & Jeff's place! Very clean and convenient to many places to eat within a short walk. The location was very quiet as well. Highly recommended!!!
509972	21657561	41933	20281154	Colby	Sarah and Jeff's place was great. Quick response and very accommodating. Myself and a friend stayed 4 nights. The access to public transportation was fantastic as was the proximity to dining and shopping in Wicker Park. They had the pull out couch prepped for us in addition to the bed. Lots of towels and water and snacks in the mini-fridge. I would stay here again and recommend it for anyone traveling to the area. 
509972	21895888	41938	19008445	Mei	Sarah was very quick to respond to any queries. During our stay, Sarah also checked to make sure things were okay. The place is located in a great neighborhood with easy access to transit. Sarah and Jeff's place is clean, cozy and comfortable--highly recommend this place! 
509972	22693319	41955	2526190	Chloe	We only have three words for these guys and this place..... THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!!! Having stayed here once before, we knew exactly where to go to have another ultimate Chicago experience. We had to stay at Sarah and Jeffâ€™s!!!!!!!!!!You really canâ€™t beat a place this cozy and warm. Itâ€™s close to all the Bucktown/Wicker Park happenings, is right near public transport, and has most helpful hosts living quietly above you. Sarah and Jeff are the king and queen of Airbnb and thereâ€™s no place better than here.We highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone who is visiting Chicago. Itâ€™s our home away from home.  
509972	22949340	41961	12808809	Kevin	Awesome place to stay! Replied to messages quickly, place clean and affording, awesome neighborhood within walking distance of a few great spots. They even left a note for us explaining small details.
509972	25162902	42012	16595550	Paula	Great spot to be in Chicago! Highly recommended. Spacious, warm and comfy, with an awesome location.Sarah and Jeff are terrific hosts, always reachable and with great disposition.The apartment was very clean (their book collection is superb!) with a nice welcome note at my arrival. For this to be my first experience with Airbnb, it set the bar pretty high. If I visit Chicago again, I will definitely try to stay there again.
509972	25319886	42016	8517320	Zufan	Sarah and Jeff's house is lovely! It's in a great neighborhood, with lots in striking distance. There is easy street parking on the block, and I was welcomed with nice notes about the apartment, snacks, and some drinks in the fridge. The apartment was beautifully decorated, and warm and cozy ( I was there in the height of the Chicago winter). They are super nice, just upstairs, and available if you need anything!
509972	25419146	42019	25513617	Donald	As described, good location, nice place, fair price. 
509972	25602244	42024	3559517	Don	Sarah and Jeff were the perfect hosts. They were very accommodating from check in, to satisfying our every need. Their place is great for a traveling couple like ourselves and the location is excellent. Thank you guys!
509972	26065188	42037	8881696	Francesca	Staying with Sarah and Jeff was by far the best Airbnb experience I've had so far. They were nothing but helpful - even to the point that they messaged me on our day of departure and told us that we could stay past out check-out time if we needed to because of a snowstorm in the city. The place was cosy and just what we wanted with a perfect location as it says on the listing. Very very happy customers, couldn't recommend more! We will definitely be staying again when we come back to Chicago!Thanks guys!
509972	26361241	42045	5004630	Vanessa	Sarah was very prompt and clear in emails. The place was perfect. Very Private and although a basement apartment it was very quiet. The bedroom was cozy and warm. We were happy. 
509972	26733559	42053	11344001	Jaci	Sarah and Jeff were very welcoming. They responded to inquiries promptly, left great suggestions for what to do in the area, and were very friendly. We got in at night so we didn't see them when we checked in, but they left clear instructions for how to get into the apartment and a cute note greeting us when we arrived - it was a great visit! 
509972	26931917	42057	5735945	Alexandra	My mom and I had a lovely experience staying at Sarah and Jeff's! Met Sarah briefly upon our arrival and from then on the place was ours. It was nice to know they were often upstairs in case we needed anything. There's no kitchen, like the ad says, but that was fine with us. They provided a kettle, there was a mini fridge and microwave, and plenty of tea and little snacks.We were mostly exploring, but we loved the Map Room around the corner (for beers over coffee!) and the neighborhood is lovely. Oh and their book collection is unreal- I would almost go back just to sample their library. Thanks for a great stay, guys =)
509972	27573354	42071	24977747	Lauren	After a trek in the cold and snow, I was so thankful that Sarah and Jeff had left the heater on in the apartment! A cute handwritten note, fresh towels and sheets, and snacks made me feel at home so far away from Florida. The apartment was exactly what I needed for a week long internship: privacy, ample space, bright natural lighting, and a comfortable bed. The convenience of having cafes and restaurants so nearby was fantastic, and it was only 4 minutes away from my clinic sight! I would would gladly stay here again. Although I didn't get to meet Sarah and Jeff, they were good at communicating and happy to help if any need arose. 
509972	27757927	42074	14677868	Jorge	The apartment is great! It's located in one of the most interesting neighborhoods in the city, with many restaurants that are in walking distance. Location is also convenient in terms of transportation, as there are various metro stops nearby. Sarah and Jeff left snacks for us when we arrived (much appreciated!) and even had Netflix on their TV.... so we binged watched House of Cards. Great place and great hosts. Highly recommended!
509972	27998702	42079	10393802	Aaron	Perfect location, inviting decor, great hosts!  Would stay here again anytime.
509972	28805580	42093	63793	Brent	What a cozy little light-filled nest in the city. Sarah and Jeff made us feel especially welcome, and we had a lovely time. 
509972	29251308	42100	1671037	Wayne	Sarah was great! The apartment was clean, cozy, and well located. Sarah texted to check-in on us and was extremely communicative. There were maps of the area, and a list of local spots for us to check out as well.
509972	29723254	42106	23892315	Lisan	Sarah and Jeff got a great place to stay in a hip neighbourhood. Close to the Blue line, near a lovely spot for breakfast ( Red June) . Sarah and Jeff  made us feel at home , helped us on our  way, information about Chicago available in the appartement .  Hope to return on a next visit to Chicago
509972	29949741	42108	6180811	David	Sara and Jeff's garden apartment is located on sleepy residential street with what seemed to be ample parking. Its fairly central location makes exploring the surrounding area easy as pie. The lack of a kitchen hindered my stay 0%, there is a minifridge for drinks/leftovers etc.  The place was very clean and tidy. Their selection of reading material is excellent. Its perfect for people on business as they seem to be early risers. 
509972	30083101	42111	29366590	Emmeline	Jeff and Sarah are very welcomming hosts: Jeff showed us the appartement, which was clean, cosy and completely met the description. They provided us with some snacks and drinks, which was great! In the appartement are maps available and a description of restaurants and shops nearby.We enjoyed our stay in the appartement! 
509972	30284433	42114	22775	Brendan	Everything was great at Sarah and Jeff's WP/Bucktown apartment. Little snacks to welcome us and send us on our way. Super responsive. We didn't need to connect with Sarah and Jeff while we were there, but I'm sure if we needed anything they would have been extremely accomodating and helpful. It was a great neighborhood with sooo many good restaurants. Location does require a bit of walking to get to main metro stations, but it helps you burn off the calories from the great restaurants (Hot Chocolate, Big Star, Chop House, Stan's Donuts, Red June Cafe). We probably walked 10-15 miles during the entire weekend (all around the city, not just from their place to the metro). All in all this was a fantastic stay. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking to explore any and all parts of Chicago.Photos are about 99% accurate with exceptions to the couch and appearance of bathroom (bathroom is perfect and everything works, color is just not white). Nothing wrong with what's actually there, it was just slightly different than I expected and doesn't change the fact that I would absolutely stay with Sarah and Jeff again.
509972	30754339	42121	20937360	Yvette	Great instructions and directions before traveling, and Sarah & Jeff made me feel very welcome throughout my stay. This is really a lovely, comfortable place, well-situated for great coffee shops, restaurants, bars etc. and very easy for the airport and downtown. Thoroughly recommended! 
509972	31195204	42127	2865101	Benjamin	Sarah and Jeff are great hosts.  They were super responsive to any questions we had. Their garden apartment is a great alternative to staying in the downtown area of Chicago. It is perfectly situated in the Wicker Park neighborhood. Plenty of street parking, should you rent a car. Public transportation is just around the corner.  The snacks and drinks that they provided us was great and our overall experience with Sarah and Jeff was superior. This was my first experience using Airbnb and my wife and I highly recommend future travelers to give their place a shot. You will not be disappointed. 
509972	31626624	42132	16256209	Kasia	Sarah and Jeff's apartment was perfect for our Chicago getaway. The apartment is located in a hip suburb with plenty of cafes and cool shops within walking distance. Public transport is nearby (10 min walk) and super easy to use. The apartment itself is cosy and clean and Sarah and Jeff provide everything you may need (including little snacks on our arrival!). Sarah and Jeff were super easy to communicate with and check-in/ check-out was easy. We would highly recommend this apartment for your next visit to Chicago! 
509972	31869469	42135	13857688	Claire & Adam	We loved our stay at Sarah & Jeff's place! They were very helpful and responsive before and during our stay. The apartment is located on an adorable street (with ample parking) near lots of great shops and restaurants. We would definitely recommend their place and hope to stay there again in the future!
509972	32450429	42142	18063707	Amahad	My fiancÃ© and I had a good time staying at Sarah and Jeff's place on our trip to Chicago. The location couldn't have been any better. Tucked along a quiet residential street in the Bucktown neighborhood. It was really close to public transportation, shopping and great restaurants. The bed was super cozy. It should be noted that there is no fan in the apartment, so we had to open the windows to get air circulation. Also, this is a garden level apartment, so there are times when footsteps and moving furniture could be kind of disturbing. That said, staying with Sarah and Jeff is a great choice.
509972	32956951	42148	21709387	Margaret	"Location, location.....location!!! Having never been to Chicago that's what we were looking for when we made this reservation and it truly delivered. A wonderful listing in what appeared to be one of the finest suburbs of the city. Literally oozing with chic cafes, shops and cool restaurants within walking distance. The whole area was safe and  populated by polite and trendy hipsters!!  Sarah and Jeff were wonderful ""easy going"" hosts that made us feel welcome even before arrival and during our stay and genuinely seemed please to accomodate us. Jeff gave us a few restaurant tips that we followed up on and they were worth the recommendation. So all in all a great value booking in the Windy City! "
509972	33281190	42150	32129302	Ryan	Our stay at Sarah and Jeff's was great! The listing was accurate and they were nice enough to leave out some snacks and a few local beers for our arrival. They were very responsive to any questions we had leading up to our trip which was very helpful. We would certainly stay here again. 
509972	33978773	42158	25965424	Erin	We absolutely LOVED staying at Sarah and Jeff's place. The location was superb. Very easy to get to and from various areas of town and the airpot. Sarah was also very helpful in making us feel welcome. She was always quick to respond to our questions -- even when I needed help finding a printer/scanner for some work documents. They even left a little note welcoming us to Chicago. The place was clean and the neighborhood was quiet. This was our first airbnb experience and I don't think it could've gone any better. Thanks for making your home feel like our home for a few days! 
509972	34410129	42163	5063159	Tomasz	It was a pleasure to meet Sarah and Jeff, and I am grateful for the chance to stay in their beautiful place.  It was so welcoming and comfortable.  I am a librarian who appreciates literature and book collections, so I really enjoyed the books.   The place is located on a quiet street in a great neighborhood.  It is close to downtown Chicago with the blue line, close to lively local streets nearby.  The neighborhood cafes, bookstores, bars and restaurants have taste and character.   I would stay here again if I have the opportunity to return to Chicago.
509972	35062402	42170	27049442	Anna	What  a great experience!!  First off, Sarah and Jeff are amazing hosts.  They had the apartment clean and in great order and even had snacks to welcome us with!  It was very kind that Sarah contacted me later that evening to ensure we had everything we needed.The neighborhood is amazing!  Great walkability and proximity to great local businesses and proximity to the bus lines and train station.  It was very exciting to discover and explore a Chicago neighborhood.
509972	36079359	42180	6754446	Jacqui	We had a really great stay in Sarah and Jeff's apartment in Chicago.It's situated in a lovely neighbourhood with vibrant bars, restaurants and shops only a 5 minute walk away in the Wicker Park area.It's also very convenient and easy access to both the airport and downtown on the blue line.The apartment is very comfy with a lovely TV and great offer of Apple TV.  Would thoroughly recommend staying here. 
509972	36707234	42185	7309113	Bryan	This was my first AirBnB experience that I wouldn't repeat.  Sarah was a great host, the garden level unit was acceptable, but the deal-breaker for me was the amount of noise transparency from the tenants above.  I had 4 consistent horrible nights of sleep due to the noise from the folks above.  It's not that they were unreasonably loud, it's just that you hear every footstep, every cabinet door open, chair move, etc, etc.  Once I was up, I really didn't care.  But not being able to sleep is a deal-breaker for me and waking up at 6:30am on my weekend vacation 4-days in a row is something I will never repeat.Otherwise, the place is in a great neighborhood right by Map Room and is priced at a very competitive rate.  It definitely wasn't the cleanest place I've stayed in but they did stock the mini-fridge with some beverages and left a sweet note on the dresser.Sarah was super responsive and seems like a great person.  
509972	36943694	42188	27986462	Scott	This place was perfect for me. I was in Chicago for a short business trip. The apartment was comfortable, conveniently located, well furnished. I have absolutely no complaints. It was a cozy place with friendly and helpful hosts. Would definitely recommend.
509972	37312021	42191	676293	Jonathan	The apartment is in a great location and Sarah was a super attentive host who made us feel really welcome at their place - I even had a package shipped to me and they had it ready with a welcome note when we arrived.  During our stay there was a problem next door that required construction (that wasn't Sarah and Jeff's fault) and Sarah was quick to reach out and check if we were ok and offer solutions. We really appreciated it and understand why they are superhosts.
509972	38096090	42198	26501193	Cheryl	We had a great time staying at Sarah & Jeff's place for 6 days. The place is not huge, but it was adequate for our needs. The little touches (snacks, welcome card) were very sweet. The neighborhood was lovely (we especially recommend Xoco for dinner and The Bongo Room for brunch!) and it felt like we got to see a neighborhood of Chicago that we wouldn't have seen otherwise while still being within about a 10-minute El ride from downtown. As others have noted, there isn't much insulation between the apartment and the main house upstairs, so it may disturb you if you're a light sleeper but was not an issue for us. The only cons were clearly described in the listing, but it would have been great to have at least local TV (I love the Today show in the morning, and we couldn't stream live TV) and a coffee maker would be a welcome addition to the space. We had a great time!
509972	38590826	42202	18899038	Junejune	It's so nice to stay here.Sarah and Jeff are so enthusiastic to host us.The  location is near the subway so that you can go anywhere you like so easy.The house is clean and cozy,everything you need is available.also the snacks and soda.We like this house so much,
509972	38977258	42205	547077	Nicole	We had a great stay. We didn't actually meet Sarah and Jeff due to scheduling on our side, but all communication was very friendly and helpful. The place is set up very well to come and go as you please without disturbing anyone. Great snacks and mini fridge with refreshments was a nice added touch. Everything was clean and cozy. The books were great. This was a wonderful spot to recharge after running around the city all day. Thanks again!
509972	39526562	42209	5539740	Normand	Nous avons passÃ© un trÃ¨s agrÃ©able sÃ©jour chez Sarah et Jeff qui nous ont trÃ¨s bien accueillis. L'appartement Ã©tait impeccable. Sarah et Jeff avaient laissÃ© pour nous des boissons et une collation en guise de bienvenue. Nous avons particuliÃ¨rement apprÃ©ciÃ© le guide des visites Ã  pied de Chicago qui Ã©tait dans l'appartement et le guide des restos, cafÃ©s, Ã©piceries sympathiques du quartier prÃ©parÃ© par nos hÃ´tes. L'appartement est trÃ¨s bien situÃ©, dans un quartier Â«Â inÂ Â» de Chicago oÃ¹ on trouve plein de bons restos, cafÃ©s, etc. et Ã  quelques minutes du transport en commun. On aurait apprÃ©ciÃ© qu'il y ait une cafetiÃ¨re dans l'appartement.Merci Ã  Sarah et Jeff pour cette belle semaine Ã  Chicago,Esther et Normand
509972	40522661	42216	5309982	Itia	This is really a nice, quiet neighborhood, walkable dinner places, with convenient commute options. We had great time staying here.There are indeed somethings that I think may help in future, though:1. The sofa is different than the one shown on the picture, though we dont have problem sitting on it.2. The air condition is nice but will be great if it can be a little bit quieter3. Full bed is a bit small for us, since my wife is pregnant.
509972	41083973	42220	1630576	Derek	Sarah and Jeff were incredibly welcoming and super responsive.Their place was the perfect size for my wife and I and was close to the blue line for getting downtown and around the neighborhoods we enjoy visiting.There's no kitchen or anything, but most hotel rooms don't have kitchens either, so we didn't mind that at all... but there was a (stocked!) mini-fridge which was nice.
509972	41387290	42223	36709483	Kathy	Sarah and Jeff are fab hosts and have a cute little space--just perfect for a home base to explore Chicago.  Super happening neighborhood with excellent food and drink--we were on our way home one night and were treated to a 16 piece big band at Gallery Cabaret--no cover!  A short walk to the overhead brings you in to the heart of the Loop--Art Institute, Millennium Park, Buckingham Fountain, amazing skyscrapers.  If you like to walk you can hoof it over to Lincoln Park and see the Zoo, the Lily Pond, Old Town and the Gold Coast (there's also a bus if you don't feel like walking).  Great space, great hosts and great town.  You should go!
509972	41917258	42226	11340198	Sergi	The place is great, cozy and comfortable, and has a great location, walking distance to a lot of places to eat or drink, and also near the CTA. Sarah and Jeff were very helpful before and during our stay, and we found very useful their reccomendations of where to go in the neighbourhood
509972	45696775	42252	40953431	Peter	Stay was great. Great location and super nice hosts.
509972	46128160	42255	7754446	Emily	We really enjoyed our stay here. The apartment is cute and the location could not be better if you want to stay outside of downtown but still have access to lots of urban amenities like restaurants, boutiques, bike share, transit, etc. Restaurants we enjoyed were The Bristol and Le Bouchon for dinner, and Red June for coffee. Thanks for your hospitality, Sarah and Jeff!
509972	48270590	42272	35719300	Carolyn S	Great location for a former Chicagoan revisiting the city. On-street parking was readily available at all hours, something you don't always expect. Generous towels and even a hair dryer, which I didn't expect. More closet space than the two of us could use.
2867254	13327720	41784	3666683	Sebastian	Tracy was really nice and helpful. The apartment was exactly as she described it and the location was perfect since it was closed to both Downtown and Lincoln Park. There are nice restaurants in the area and the apartment is just a couple of blocks away from the lake. It was a really nice, clean and well located apartment. Thank you Tracy
2867254	14127991	41802	15789074	Erin	This was my first time using Airbnb, and Tracy made it an easy experience.  She was extremely friendly and responsive.  The place is decorated charmingly and has a very positive atmosphere.  The only thing I don't remember being advertised is that the bed is an air mattress - that was a shock.But other than that: nice place, nice location, nice owner.
2867254	15767338	41835	16372034	Marie	Tracy was a wonderful host, she answered all our questions in no time and was always available for us. The apartment was totally conform to the description, it is a nice place to stay in Chicago for a couple, very close to the center of the city. Very nice address for a couple of days. We really enjoyed our stay!
2867254	16572074	41849	7067034	Robyn	Tracy's place was great! It was exactly the way it was described in the listing, and just what we needed for a girls' trip! The location was perfect and close to everything. Tracy was also incredibly accommodating regarding check in and check out times. She also provided us with great transportation tips! 
2867254	16904475	41855	5339100	Natalie	The studio was exactly how it looks.  No surprised which is a good thing.  It was a bit small but totally
